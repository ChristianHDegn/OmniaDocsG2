Delete a draft process
=======================

**(This documentation is just started, more will be added soon.)**

If you need to delete a draft process, do the following:

1. Select the process in the list.
2. Open the dot menu and select "Delete Draft".

Note that if the process has been published at least once, the last published edition is still available for users, and a new draft can, in that case, still be created from the Published tab.
