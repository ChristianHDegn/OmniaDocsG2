Preview a process - authoring processes
==========================================

While you're working on a draft process, you can, whenever you need, enter Preview mode by clicking here:

You can also preview the process without editing, this way:

1. Open the dot menu for the process.
2. Select "Preview".

You can go on editing the process from here by clicking "Design".

When in Preview mode you can test how the process will look on different devices:

Important note about preview and different devices
---------------------------------------------------
Although you can select different devices in the preview, it's important to know that there's no scaling. The process canvas is always diplayed in 100%. The preview will show how much of the canvas that will be shown on different devices without scrolling.
