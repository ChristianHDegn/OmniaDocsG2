**Very important!** The canvas setting is the same for all devices so you have to consider what canvas size is the most user friendly for the devices most commonly used in your organization for accessing the process.

Working with shapes
--------------------
To add a shape, click "ADD SHAPE".

Exactly what is available here depends on settings for the Process Type, so this is just an example.

+ **All Shapes**: If the list of shapes is very long, you can use this field to search for a shape.
+ **Workflow**: Normally a number of workflow shapes are availble.
+ **Arrows**: Normally a number od arrow shapes are availble.
+ **Custom**: What is available here can differ a lot. Custom shapse may not be alloed at all. If custom shapes are allowed "Freeform" means you, the process author, can draw a new shape when needed. "Media" means you can upload an image to use as a shape for this process or process step. See below for more information.

Now you can work with the process step's drawing as described above.

Add a background image
-----------------------
The option for adding a background image is also available in the canvas settings. You can use this option either for just a nice background image, to place shapes on, or to upload a process image you have created in for example PowerPoint or Visio, to add clickable areas on. See below for more information about clickable areas.

To add a background image:

1. Open the Canvas Settings.
2. Click "Add Image".

3. Edit the settings for the shape (see - link to be added).
