Save, check in or discard changes - authoring processes
=========================================================

When you edit a draft changes are saved automatically and it is noted this way:

.. image:: pm-saved-data.png

On the other hand, if you have made some changes you don't want to save, you can click this option to discard them:

.. inmage:: pm-discard.png

Check in your work
--------------------
When you work on a process it's automatically checked out to you, which means no one else can work on that process until you check in.

If a process is checked out to someone, it's shown in the Process Libary, for example:

.. image:: pm-check-in-list.png

To make it possible for someone else to work on the process, check it in this way:

1. Open the process.
2. Click "CHECK IN".

Note that if someone else has checked out a process you need to edit, you can take control of the process to be able to edit it. (More information about this will be added soon).
