Here's a short overview of what to use the tabs for:

+ **Drawing**: Here you work with the graphic presentation of the process, which can also serve as a navigation of the process. You can visualize the process and the process steps by adding shapes and/or upload an image and add clickable areas to that image.
+ **Content**: Use this tab to add a description of the process or process step. You can usually use both text and images to do that.
+ **Document**: You use this tab to attach documents to the process or process step, documents that users can read.
+ **Links**: Here you can add useful links for users, for the process or process step.
+ **Tasks**: Use this tab to wotk with a To Do-list for the process or process step. Note that this is not Sharepoint Tasks, just a To Do list.
+ **Properties**: You use this tab to set the properties for the process. Available for the main level, the process, only.
