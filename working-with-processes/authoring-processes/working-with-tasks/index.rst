Working with tasks when authoring processes
==============================================

Using the Tasks tab you can see three different lists:

As it says, this list displays all tasks that have been assigned to you.

You can click the link to preview the process. 

Approve or reject a process
-----------------------------
When you approve a process for publication, the author receives a notification stating that has been done. 

You approve publication of the process the following way:

1. Click the link to check the process and then close it.
2. Type a message if you want (not mandatory).
3. Click "APPROVE".

If you reject publication for a process, the author receives a notification about that, makes necessary changes and can after that publish again. 

You reject publication of the process the following way:

1. Click the link to check the process and then close it.
2. Type a message of what needs to be changed (strictly speaking not mandatory, but something you should normally do).
3. Click "REJECT".

Assigned By Me
****************
This list displays all Tasks created, when you sent a process for publication. To check the progress for any of the tasks, click the Title. 

Something like the following is then shown:

****************
As it says, this tab displays a list of completed tasks, for example:
