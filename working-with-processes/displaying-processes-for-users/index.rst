Displaying processes for users
=================================

**(This documentation is just started, more will be added soon.)**

When considering how to display processes for end users, you can use one of these approaches, or a combination of them:

+ Add a page and place a Process Rollup to list available processes.
+ Add a separate page for every process and use a suitable Page Type.

If you use a Process Rollup you don't have to create separate pages for the processes. When a user clicks a process in the Process Rollup, a system page is then used to display the process.

If you decide to add a separate page for each process there's a Page Type ready for you to use. You can of course add your own Page Type(s) for processes or edit as well.

Here's an excample of a page with a Process Rollup:
