Cookies Consent information
===============================

If you need to add Cookies Consent information, a tip is to use the Tutorial for this purpose. 

Here's a suggestion for the text:

Omnia contains one cookie - OmniaTokenKey - for internal use only, needed for essential functionality. No tracking cookies are used in Omnia. 
No information is shared with third parties.
By closing this window you confirm the use of OmniaTokenKey. 

This text is only a suggestion. You have to make sure the text you enter is compliant with your organization's Cookies Consent Policy.

You should set this Tutorial to be available at the start page and to start automatically.

It can look something like this in the Tutorial window:
