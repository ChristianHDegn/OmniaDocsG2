2. Go to Omnia Admin > Teamwork and create a new site based on the newly create provisioning template. (If you already have a SharePoint site setup for a Controlled Documents central archive, this can be attached to Omnia and resused).
3. Find the newly create site in the Teamwork list and activate the feature "Process Archive".
4. Go to Omnia Admin > Process Management > Settings and paste the newly create site into the Archive Site Url setting.
