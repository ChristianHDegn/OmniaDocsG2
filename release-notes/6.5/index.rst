You can break the inheritance to the Tenant settings for different parts of the header on a Business Profile.

After the upgrade, existing Business Profiles will use broken inheritance to Tenant level. New Business Profiles will be set by default to inherit from Tenant level.


Workplace
------------------------------------------

When you create a new Business Profile, the system will create a workplace for the profile.

After the upgrade, existing Business Profile will run in classic mode. In order to take advantage of the new workplace features, the Business Profile needs to be updated. You can do this by going in to the Business Profile and Create a new Workplace.

Once you have created a Business Profile workplace, a new menu will appear in Omnia Admin called "Workplace".

The Business Profile Workplace provides a new possibility to work with access and navigation in your digital workplace.

In the Workplace Settings, you can decide the behavior of the chrome in different device breakpoints. You can also have different behavior on the Header and Navigation Bar in Web Browser and MS Teams client.

Enterprise Glossary
------------------------------------------

A new feature has been introduced in the Properties section in Omnia Admin, called Enterprise Glossary. In the Enterprise Glossary, it is possible to register taxonomies (term sets) that are of global interest in the solution.

Each term in a taxonomy can be then be mapped to a page that gives detailed information about that term.
