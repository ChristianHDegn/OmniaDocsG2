+ **Title**: You can edit or add a Title for the list in all languages available for the tenant. The default language is mandatory.

+ **Default tab**: Decide which tab will be shown when an author enters the Controlled Documents library.
+ **Paging**: Select paging for the lists here; “No paging”, “Classic” or “Scroll”.
+ **Page Size**: Set the number of rows to display. **Important Note**: If more documents or tasks are available than the Page Size set, a navigation to the next page is shown when Paging is set to "Classic". If Paging is set to either "No paging" or "Scroll", Page Size is the maximum number of documents or tasks that can be shown in the lists, regardless of how many are available.
+ **Padding**: Set some padding around the lists, if needed.
+ **Hide Tasks Tab**: If the Tasks tab should not be displayed for authors, select this option.

Drafts
--------
The following settings are available here:

.. image:: edit-controlled-library-drafts.png

+ **Default Ordering Field**: Select the column for default sort order for the list.
+ **Show Search Box**: If authors should be able to search for documents here, select this option.
+ **Display columns in draft view**: To add a new column, select it in the list and click "Add". To remove a column. click the dust bin. If no dust bin is shown for a column it's mandatory, and therefore can't be removed. You can set the order of the columns by grabbing the Equal To icon for the column and drag it to another place in the list.

Published
------------
The same type of settings as for Drafts are available here:

You can also add groups or users by typing the name in the field.

If permission groups are used, as in the example above, you can add and remove users in these groups by using the Sharepoint standard functionality "Advanced permissions settings".
