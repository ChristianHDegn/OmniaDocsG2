Using the Document Wizard
===========================

(**Note! This description is just started. More will be added and edited soon.**)

When you create a new Controlled Document or a normal document where the Document Wizard is activated, you normally see a list of the templates available. It can look like this:

Creating a new Controlled Document
************************************
Use the Wizard this way to create a new Controlled Document:

1. See to that "Controlled Document" is selected.

2. Select language.

When a template is created, the language for the template is set. 

3. Select the Document Type the template belongs to. You may have to open a group to find the Document Type you're after, as this example shows:

The Document Types are set up in Omnia Admin.

4. Select Template.
5. Some settings are most likely needed. Which settings depends on the Document Type. Heres an example:

6. Select template (in this exempla only one template is available for the Document Type, but there can be several). You must click on the template, even of there's only one, for the fields to be shown.
7. Add a title for the new document.
8. Edit the file name if needed.

7. Select where to save the new document. The active site is selected in the "suggested" list.

If you want to save the file somewhere else, use the lists "Suggested", "Followed" and "All" to navigate to teh site. Note that all three lists may not ne shown depending on settings in Omnia Admin.

8. Click "Create".

The document is now created in the chosen location and you can work on the normal way.

**Note!** If you come across metadata fields visible in the document, displayed within double brackets, they should not be used in the editing process. Information will be added to these fields when the document is published.
