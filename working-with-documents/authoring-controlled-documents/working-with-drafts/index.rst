Working with Drafts
====================================

"Drafts" is used when creating and editing drafts for new Controlled Documents or when updating an existing document for a new edition. Note that there are several options available for creating a new draft document, see below.

When a document is published (approved for publication) it is removed from Drafts and is available on the "Published" tab. 

Most headings in the Drafts list can be used to sort the list.

Creating a draft document
**************************
When adding documents to a Controlled Documents library the author can either create a new draft or upload a document. If it’s a Controlled Document the author will actually work with here, a document should normally be created from scratch. If it’s a document that will be used as it is, for example as an appendice, it makes more sense to upload the document.

Creating a new draft document
----------------------------------
Do the following to create a new Controlled Document:

1. Click "Add" and select "New".

.. image:: new-controlled-document-1.png

.. image:: new-controlled-document-2.png

The Create New Document Wizard starts and you use ut to create the document. See this page for information on how to use the wizard: :doc:`Using the Document Wizard </working-with-documents/using-the-document-wizard/index>`

Upload documents
---------------------
An alternative is to upload existing documents, but normally it should be used just for documents that will be added as they are, but will still be handled as Controlled Documents, for example with approval before publishing.

The template for the Document Type is not used for the first edition of the document, the document will be used with the exeisting template (if any). The next time a draft is created for an uploaded document, the template can be replaced, if needed.  See *Edit a document's properties* below for more information.

Do the following to upload a document:

1. Click "Add" and select "Upload".

.. image:: upload-document-1.png

2. Use drag and drop or click "Browse" to select one or more documents to upload.

.. image:: upload-document-2.png

3. If you need to edit a file name, just click it and type the new file name.
4. Click "Upload".

Edit a document's properties
*****************************
You may need to edit a document's properties before publishing, if you uploaded a document, and if any of the properties needs to be changed for a draft. Note that a document's properties can't be changed for a published document. You always have to publish a new edition of a document to be able to change properties.

Do the folllowing:

1. Select the document and click "Properties".

.. image:: edit-properties-1-new.png

If this option is not shown you can open the dot menu for the document and select "Properties" there.

If your doing this for an uploaded document that is not connected to a template you can now select template.

2. Select language if needed.

.. image:: edit-properties-2b.png

3. Select a template to connect to the uploaded document. To see a list of all available templates, click "Show All".

Now properties for the document are shown (and this is what is shown for a document you have created), and it differs depending on the template (or rather the Document Type the template belongs to). Here's an example:

.. image:: edit-properties-3.png

**Note!** You can even choose another template for the document here, if needed. Click the x for the existing template and select another template.

3. Edit the properties as needed and save.

Upload Appendices
*******************
To upload documents to use as appendices to another document, the main upload option should not be used.

Note that work with appendices (uploading new ones, deleting existing) can only be done when you are working on a draft of the document. If a document is sent for comments or for approval, appendices can not be uploaded to that document. 

Also note that a Document Type contains a setting that states if appendices are allowed or not. For a document tied to a Document Type with appendices not allowed, the Appendices option is not available.

An icon indicates if appendices are attached to a document, and states the number of appendices, and if the "Appendices" column is shown, information about the number of appendices is shown there as well. Here's an example:

.. image:: appendix-example.png

Upload or delet appendices this way:

1.	Open the dot menu for the document to add appendices to.

.. image:: upload-appendice-1.png

2. Select "Appendices".

.. image:: upload-appendice-2.png

A list of existing appendices is now shown, if any. You can now upload a new appendice or make a copy of a published document to use as an appendice, see below.

Upload a new appendice
------------------------
To upload a new appendice, do the following:
 
1.	Click "Upload".

.. image:: upload-appendice-3.png

2. Use drag and drop or click "Browse" to select one or more documents to upload.

.. image:: upload-appendice-4.png

3. If you need to edit a file name, just click it and type the new file name.
4. Click "Upload".

.. image:: upload-appendice-5.png
 
When the upload is finished the file(s) is visible in the Appendices list for the document, for example:

.. image:: upload-appendice-6.png

A document can be opened from here by clicking the link. Click the pen to edit the file name. Click the dust bin to remove the document from the list.
 
Appendices can be added to this list continuously up to publication of the document. If appendices needs to be removed or added for a published document, a new edition of the document must be published.

**Note!** An appendix uploaded as shown above will not be visible in the Drafts list, but will only exist as a part of the main document. When a document with appendices is published, both the main document and the appendices are approved in one go. The appendices does not have to be approved separately (but also see below).

Published documents as Appendices - Copy from other document
---------------------------------------------------------------
Another option is to add a copy of a published document as an Appendice. All published documents are available to select as appendice.

**Note!** In this case it is a copy of a document that will be added. There is no link between the published document and the copy, so if a new edition of the Appendice document is published, the copy used as an appendix is NOT updated.

1. Open the dot menu for the document where you want to add appendices, and select "Appendices".
2. Click "Copy from other Document" in the window shown.

.. image::  upload-copy-1.png

The following is shown:

.. image:: upload-copy-2.png
 
3. Search for the document. 
4. Select the document(s) to add (a copy of) as appendice(s).
5. Choose to overwrite existing appendices or not. This option is useful if a new version of a document you use as a appendice has been published and you want to replace the old copy with the new edition.
6. Click "Copy".

.. image:: uupload-copy-3.png
 
The documents added to the Appendices list this way is handled exactly the same way as a document uploaded as an appendix, see above. (And remember that it is a copy of the original document.)

Creating a new draft from a published document
***********************************************
The work on a draft for a new edition of a document can be started whenever it’s convenient. The existing published edition is still available for readers until it’s replaced, when the new edition is published.

To create a new draft of a published document, do the following:

1.	Open the "Published" tab.
2.	Click the dot menu for the document.
3.	Select "Create Draft".

.. image:: create-draft-1.png

4. Select which edition to base the new draft on.

.. image:: create-draft-2.png

As you see you can even upload a document to base the new draft on. This can be useful for example when you want to publish a new edition of a document you have uploaded as it is.

If you select "Previous Edition", you can select which of the previous published editions you want to base the new Draft on. If you want to have a look at that edition before deciding, you can download a copy of the previous edition you selected in the list, by clicking this icon:

.. image:: create-draft-3.png

5. When you're done there, click "Create Draft".

The new draft is created and the "Drafts" tab is automatically activated. The work on the new draft is done exactly as the first time. That a document has been published before does not make any difference.

**Note!** There can be only one draft of a given document. If there already is a draft for the document and an author tries to create another on, a message is shown stating that it's not possible. 
 
New drafts and templates
***************************
If there is a new version of the template used for the document, the author will be notified and can choose to use the new version of the template, or stick to the old one.

A special case is when a new draft is created from a Word or Excel document that was uploaded rather than created from scratch. When a new draft for a second edition is created, the template can be altered (or rather selected). But using a template for an uploaded document is never mandatory, the document can always be used as is.

When selecting a template for an uploaded document, it’s always a good idea to use the preview to make sure the selected template actually works for the document.

If a template is selected, this document is from now on related to the template the same way as when a new document is created from scratch on the "Drafts" tab.

Even if a template is not selected for the second edition, the author gets a new chance the next time a new draft is created.
