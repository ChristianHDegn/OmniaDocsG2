Working with Tasks
===================

Using the Tasks tab you can see three different lists:

***************
As it says, this list displays all tasks that have been assigned to you.

It can be:

+ Tasks from Send for Comments workflows - labeled "Review document" in this list.
+ Tasks from Publish workflows - labeled "Approve document" in this list.
+ Tasks for review when set Review Date has passed - labeled "Review" in this list.

To work with a task, just click the Title, and then something like the following is shown:

Assigned By Me

This list displays all Tasks created, when you sent a document for comments or when publishing a document. Note that if you assigned a Send for Comments task to more than one colleague, one task for each colleague is created, as in this example:
