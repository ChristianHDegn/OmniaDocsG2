Reading Controlled Documents
=============================

To make Controlled Documents available for users you add a Document Rollup block to a suitable page. Heres's an example of how a Controlled Documents list can look for users:

See this page for more information on how to use the Document Rollup block for this purpose: :doc:`Document Rollup </blocks/document-rollup/index>`

Under the heading "Implementation example" you can see the settings that has been made for a Controlled Documents rollup.

Sending feedback
******************
If the Document Rollup has been set up to allow it, it can be possible for users to send feedback on controlled documents.

If it's possible, this icon is available:

Note the formatting options. Also note that the receiver of the feedback e-mail is noted.
