Participate in discussions
=============================

Discussions can be set up other ways but in the default setup, any colleague can start a discussion and any colleague can participate in any discussion.

All Discussions in this community are listed on the Dicussions start page. It can look like this:

The list can be sorted on Latest, Popular or Most Commented. Popular counts the number of likes for each discussion. You can also search for discussions and comments.

You can click a tag to subscribe to that tag.

**Note!** Tags are global, so when you subscribe to a tag, you subscribe to that tag in discussions and knowledge articles in ALL active communities in the tenant.

To go to a knowledge article, to read it or to comment (or both), click the link (the name).
