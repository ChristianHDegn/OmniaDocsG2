Edit a Knowledge article
==========================

**(This documentation is just started. More will be added soon.)**

A Community can be set up in sevaral ways but the most common is probably that any colleague can edit a published Knowledge article, if needed. 

This is how it's done:

1. Open the Knowledge article.
2. Open the editor and select "Write".

3. Do the changes and save.

When editing you can do all that is available when creating Knowledge article, see: :doc:`Create Knowledge article </using-communities/knowledge-articles/create-article/index>`
