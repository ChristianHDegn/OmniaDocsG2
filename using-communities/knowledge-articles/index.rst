Add or read knowledge articles 
================================

**(This documentation is just started. More will be added soon).**

Using Knowledge articles anyone can share information with all colleagues, or within the group, if the community is set up that way. 

A start page for Knowledge articles can look like this:

All knowledge articles created in this community are listed. The list can be sorted on Latest, Top Rated or Popular. You can also search for articles.

Top rated is when colleagues use the stars to rate an article, Popular counts the number of likes for each article.

Also note that the number of comments, likes and rating is shown for every article, here:
