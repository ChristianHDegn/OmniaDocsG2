Setting up a Community
========================

Setting up a community is pretty straight forward. You need to be an Omnia Administrator or have separate access to the following in Omnia Admin:

+ Provisioning templates
+ Communities

Both these are part of the Business Profile settings.

Prerequisite
*************
The only prerequisite is that a Provsioning template for Communites must have been created, see: `Provisioning templates </admin-settings/business-group-settings/provisioning-templates/index>`

This page is intended for page editors.

Setting up access to communities
**********************************
As default all colleagues has read access to all communities, and can also create discussions, knowledge articles and add comments. If needed, this can be set up some other way using the normal permission settings available in Omnia. 

One thing you, as a page editor, will have to consider is how to create access to communities for the users. There's, for example, no dedicated blocks for that purpose. You set up access using the options available in Omnia. Here's an example using banners for access to the various communities available:
