Setting up a Community
========================

Setting up a community is pretty straight forward. You need to be an Omnia Administrator or have separate access to the following in Omnia Admin:

+ Provisioning templates (if no Provisioning template for communities has been created yet).
+ Communities.

Both these are part of the Business Profile settings. See below for links to more information.

You also need to have Page Editor permissions to a suitable page to set upp access to the community.

Prerequisite
*************
The only prerequisite is that a Provisioning template for Communites must have been created, see: `Provisioning templates </admin-settings/business-group-settings/provisioning-templates/index>`

Creating a Community
**********************
Do the following to create a community:

1. Go to Omnia Admin.
2. Open "Communities" in the Business Profile.

3. Create a Community Site according to the description on this page: `Communities </admin-settings/business-group-settings/communities/index>`
4. When the site has been created, note or copy the Url.
5. Setup access to the community some way, using the Url. (More information about that below.)

Setting up access to communities
**********************************
You set up access using the options available in Omnia. Here's an example using banners for access to the various communities available:

(MY SUBSCRIPTIONS is an action button in this example.)

This is just an example for inspiration. Access to communities can be set up many other ways in Omnia.
