Using Communities
===================

In this part of the documentation you will find information on how to use Communities, both for editors options and from an end user's point of view.

A community can be set up in different ways. Here's an example of a community start page:

This is how a community start page can look when set up with Knowledge Articles, Discussions and Subscriptions. If the community is set up some other way, the start page will be different.

When a start page is set up this way, all the latest contributions are listed, both knowledge articles and all new posts in discussions.

Top contributors can also be displayed, if the community is set up to use Activity Tracking and Activity Points. See the image above.

You can click on any post in the list to go to that discussion, comment or knowledge article. Regarding Top Contributors, or any other people list that may be available, you can click the name of a colleague to go to that persons Delve page.
