Mega Menu
=====================

This block most likely has it's main use as a part of the Workspace functionality, but can also be added to any page or Page Type, if needed.

You can find more information about the Workspace functionality here: :doc:`Workspace </admin-settings/business-group-settings/workspace/index>`

The settings are exactly the same as the settings for Mega Menu in Omnia Admin:

Layout and Write
*********************
The WRITE tab is not used here. The LAYOUT tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
