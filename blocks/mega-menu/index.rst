Mega Menu
=====================

Use this block to add an (additional) Mega Menu to any page or Page Type, if needed. The best position is most likely at the top in the Page Type.

The settings are exactly the same as the settings for Mega Menu in Omnia Admin, see the section on this page: :doc:`Settings (Business Profile) </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/index>`

The Layout tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
