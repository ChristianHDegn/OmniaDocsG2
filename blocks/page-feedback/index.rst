Page Feedback
=====================

This block makes it possible for users to send feedback about the page to the owner of the page. Here's an example:

The user just types the message in the field and clicks "Post".

If Rich Text has been enabled, some formatting options are available, here's an example:

When the post has been sent, something like the following is shown:

.. image:: page-feedback-sent.png

In Write mode a page author will see the feedback, for example:

.. image:: page-feedback-writemode-new.png

The latest feeback posts are shown here. The name of the person who sent the feedback is clickable and opens that persons Delve page, where you can, for example, find contact information.

The number in the top right corner indicates the total number of feedback posts. If you click that number, all posts are shown.
