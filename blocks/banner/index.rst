You can select a photo from your computer or do a Bing search. When using the Bing Search you simply type a search word and can then refine your search.

When you have selected an image, you can customize which part of the image to show, by using the squares and drag the borders of the image. You can also use the filters "Sepia" and "Grayscale" for image effects. Besides that you can edit the image by using the sliders "Brightness", "Contrast" and "Saturation".

You can add a video for the banner, instead of an image, either from your company's local Steam area, or from YouTube. Find the url for the video, copy it and paste in the field.
