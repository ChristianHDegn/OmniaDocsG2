You can select a photo from your computer or do a Bing search. When using the Bing Search you simply type a search word and can then refine your search.

When you have selected an image, you can customize which part of the image to show, by using the squares and drag the borders of the image. You can also use the filters "Sepia" and "Grayscale" for image effects. Besides that you can edit the image by using the sliders "Brightness", "Contrast" and "Saturation".

You can also add a video for the banner, either from your company's local Steam area, or from YouTube. Find the url for the video, copy it and paste in the field.

Targeting banners
-------------------
A banner can be targeted to any receivers that has been defined in Target Definitions. A targeted banner is only displayed to that group. No one else will see it. It works the same for Reusable banners and Custom banners.

For more information on Targeting Definitions, see: (link)targeting-definitions/index.html

To target a banner, do the following:

1. Add the banner, either a reusable banner, a banner group or a custom banner, as stated above.
2. Click the tab "Targeting settings".
3. Select "Target to".
