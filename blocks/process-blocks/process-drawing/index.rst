+ **Title**: You can add a title on any or all the available languages, and add some padding, if nedded.
+ **Padding**: Add some padding between the block frame and the content, if needed.
+ **Stack Process**: Normally when you select a sub process, the main process is closed, and the drawing for the main process is not shown. Select this option if you want the main process's drawing, and all the drawings for the selected steps, to be shown at the same time. (An example image will be added soon).
