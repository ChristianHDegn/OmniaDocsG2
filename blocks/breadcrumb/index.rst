Breadcrumb
===========================================

The breadcrumb block makes it possible for end user to navigate to any parent node of the current page in the navigation structure.

For physical pages, that is not part of the navigation structure (for example news articles), it will show the welcome page of the current publishing sites as the parent node.

+ **Include Tenant node**: Select this option to always display the Tenant Node. The text for this is set in Omnia Admin, in the Title field under Tenant-Settings-General.
+ **Include Business Profile node**: Select this option to always display the Business Profile node. The text for this is the name for the Business Profile as set in Omnia Admin, Tenant-Business Profiles.
+ **Include Publishing App default node**: This is especially useful if there are several Page Collections in a Publishning App, and you want to show that they belong together. The Title of the Publishing App is set when it's created and can later be edited in Omnia Admin under Publishing for the Business Profile.
+ **Exclude Current node**: To not show the current node in the breadcrum, select this option.
