Taxonomy Navigation
========================

In this block, that will be available in Omnia 6.5, you can create taxonomy based navigation. One example could be navigation for the products within a product group, but it can be anything really, as long as there is a taxonomy available to base the navigation on.

(A documentation will be added soon.)
