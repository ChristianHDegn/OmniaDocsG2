Controlled Documents Rollup
********************************
Here's an example of how it can look for users when a Document Rollup block is set up for Controlled Documents access:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-1new2.png

The following settings are used:

General
--------
Here, just the Title for the list is added in this example:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-2new2.png

Query
------
The following settings are made for Query:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-6new3.png

Note the star (*) in the Query Field, meaning All (in this case Published Controlled Documents).

Display
--------
For Display the following settings are made in this example:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-3new2.png

And these:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-4new2.png

The "Classic" Paging results in a navigation at the bottom of the list:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-5new2.png

Filter
--------
The following filters are set up (General):

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-7new2.png

No further settings are made for Filter Style.

Refiners
-----------
Finally, Refiners are set up this way:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-8new2.png

As you can see, there are four refiners set up. (But only two of them are visible in the example image for the Controlled Documents rollup.)

The Zone Width is set up this way:

.. image:: document-rollup-controlled-zone.png

No further settings are made for Refiner Style.
