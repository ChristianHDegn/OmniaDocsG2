Announcements
===========================================

Announcements are created by administrators and will display important information in the whole tenant, or for a certain business profile. The Priority (status) of an announcement can be Normal or High. Announcements can be displayed at the top or in a block, which is what's described here.

The end user experience

+ **Title**: If a title should be shown for the block, add it in this field. If no variation exists for the page, it looks like in the image above and you can set the title in the languages active in the tenant. If variations exists, only one title can be set. In that case, titles in other languages are set in the variations.
+ **Announcement View Type**: Select to display Normal Announcements or High Priority Announcements.
+ **Padding**: Use this option to set some padding for the text within the block.

Custom Colors

Colors should be set centrally for consistency, but if needed, the following custom colors can be set here:
