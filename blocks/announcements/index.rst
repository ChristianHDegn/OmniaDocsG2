Announcements
===========================================

Announcements are created by administrators and will display important information in the whole tenant, or for a certain business profile. The Priority (status) of an announcement can be Normal or High. Announcements can be displayed at the top, in the Notification panel, or in a block, which is what's described here.

Commenting Announcements (will this work????)
-------------------------------------
If commenting is allowed for the Announcement (set indivually for each Announcement) any user can comment the announcement. It works the same way as commenting a publishing page, for example news. The number of comments for each message are shown in the list, for example:
