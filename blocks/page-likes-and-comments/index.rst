It is possible for the end user to edit and delete a comment, made by the user, by clicking the edit pen icon.

When a comment is deleted it works this way: If there are no answers to the comment it will just be removed. If there are answers, the  comment will be replaced with a text that states that it has been deleted and by whom. Everyone can delete their own comments. A Site Collection administrator can delete any comment.
