Page Likes and Comments
===========================================

The block makes it possible for the end user to like and comment a specific web page, including news and community pages (knowledge articles and discussions). It is also possible to reply to comments and it can be possible to use mentions. Besides that, users can share the page with others by e-mail.

It is possible for the end user to edit and delete a comment, made by the user, by using the menu.

When a comment is deleted it works this way: If there are no answers to the comment it will just be removed. If there are answers, the  comment will be replaced with a text that states that it has been deleted and by whom. Everyone can delete their own comments. A Site Collection administrator can delete any comment. 

Turning the options on or off
-------------------------------
When the block is added to a page (or to the Page Type), authors can turn on or off likes and/or comments using Write mode.

This can be very handy if Page Likes and Comments is present in a Page Type, but should not be used on every page.

More on Likes and Comments
***************************
Users can like comments as well as pages.

If a number of users likes a page, that information can be clicked to display a list of the users that has liked the page or comment.

**Note!** Likes on comments does not affect trending in any way.

Several options, for example to add an image, can be available in the Limited RTF Editor, depending on how it is set up. See this page for more information: :doc:`RTF Editor settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/rtf-editor/index>`
