Power App block
=====================

Use this block to add an app built according to Microsoft's Power App framework.

This is a new block to come in Omnia 6.7. 

For this to work you must add the Url to the App Finder in Tenant settings: :doc:`Power App Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/system/power-apps-tenant/index>`
