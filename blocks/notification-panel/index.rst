Notification Panel
===========================================

Several Notification Panels can be created in Omnia Admin, for various notification purposes. See this page for more information: :doc:`Notification Panel settings </admin-settings/business-group-settings/notification-panel/index>`

Here's an example of a Notification Block as seen by users:

.. image:: block-notification-panel-example.png

The notification block can be displayed in the Action Menu or as a block on any page, which is described here. Wether the Notification Panel should be displayed in the Action Menu is set up in Omnia Admin, in Business Profile/Settings/Header/Action Menu. See this page for more information: :doc:`Header settings for the Business Profile </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/header/index>`

As it's actually a Notification Panel block used in the Action Menu as well, it means the settings are identical to those described here, but they have to be made in Omnia Admin.

Settings
**********
The following settings are available for the block:

+ **Vertical**: Select this to show the categories vertically instead of horisontally. See below for an example.
+ **Show Slider**: (A description will be added soon.)
+ **Fill Space**: Select this option to let the icons and/or labels fill the whole available space. This has no effect if the space is narrow.
+ **Show Icon**: Select this option to display icons for the categories.
+ **Show Label**: Select this option to display labels for the categories.
+ **Tab Alignment**: Use these settings to align the tab icons/text in the available space.
+ **Icon Alignment**: If you have selected both Show Icons and Show Text you can use these settings to align the icons relative to the labels. If you have selected only Show Icons or only Show Labels, this option is not shown.
+ **Custom Size**: Use this to set a minimum height and/or width for the navigation area in the block (does not affect the content area).
+ **Border Radius**: (A description will be added soon.)

Heres an example with the categories shown vertically, with icons (no labels):
