General
------------
Here you acn add a title for the block, if needed.

+ **Title**: If a title should be shown for the block, add it in this field. If variations exists, as is in the image above, only one title can be set. In that case, titles in other languages are set in the variations. If no variation exists for the page, you can set the title in the languages active in the tenant. 

Display
---------
Here you select the properties to display.

+ **Show label**: Decide to show the block label or not.
+ **Custom label**: Add a custom label here if needed.
+ **Date Type**: For Date Type you can choose Default, Classic or Social.

---------
Use the Style tab for these settings:

+ **Padding** You can add some padding around the content of the block, or for each item, if needed.
+ **Label Position**: You can set the label position at the top or to the left.
+ **Horizontal**: If you want the properties to be shown side by side instead, which may make sense if you add the block to a broader part of the page, select this option.
+ **Hide Separator**: When you select Horizontal, you can choose to use a searator line, or not.

Here's an example with the information shown horizontally, with a separator:
