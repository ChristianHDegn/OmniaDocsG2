Page Properties
===========================================

Use this block to show information about the page, for example when it was last edited and by whom. Here's an example:

.. image:: page-properties-info.png

The following settings are available for the block:

.. image:: page-properties-settings-new2.png

+ **Title**: If a title should be shown for the block, add it in this field. If no variation exists for the page, it looks like in the image above and you can set the title in the languages active in the tenant. If variations exists, only one title can be set. In that case, titles in other languages are set in the variations.
+ **Select Properties**: Use the list the select properties for the information you want to display. Click the plus to add the property, and make sure it's selected.
+ **Padding** You can add some padding around the content of the block, if needed.

Here's an example with the properties for the image above selected:

.. image:: page-properties-settings-example.png

If a selected property should not be shown, just deselect it. You can delete a property from the list by clicking the dust bin.
