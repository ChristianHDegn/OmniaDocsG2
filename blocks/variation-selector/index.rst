Page Variation Selector
=========================

Use this block to make it possible for end users to select a variation of the page. For more information about Page Variations, see: :doc:`Page Settings </pages/page-settings/index>`

Here's an example of the block placed in a section at the top of the page, in this case part of the Page Type:

.. image:: page-variation-selector-new.png

The block will simply show a list of the available Page Variations when opened.

The only setting that can be done for the block is this:

.. image:: page-variation-setting.png

+ **Hide if no variations exist for the page**: This option is selected by default. If you want the block to always be shown, even if no Page Variations exists (yet), deselect this option.

The tabs Layout and Advanced contain general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
