Accordion
=====================

With this block you can add the posibility to enter expandle text on a page. The content is added using Write mode.

In Omnia 6.5, this block is replaced by the FAQ block, see this page for more information: :doc:`The FAQ block </blocks/faq/index>`

Also note that in Omnia 6.5 there's an Accordion section available, but that's a section, not a block.

For the end user an Accordion entry can look like this:

2. Click the plus in the Accordion block.

Something like the following is shown (available options depends on admin settings):

3. Add an Accordion Title at the top. This is the expandable text.
4. Add the text that should be shown when the title is expanded. Note the formatting options.

Here's an example:
