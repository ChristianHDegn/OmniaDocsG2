Using Omnia Feed
===================

**(This documentation is just started. More will be added very soon.)**

With Omnia Feed you stay connected to your organizations Omnia Intranet wherever you go. 

Omnia Feed can be set up in many different ways to make it possible for users to read information from your organization's intranet, on their mobile device. A good example is News, but it can be any page(s) really, and anything that can be accessed by a link.

The Omnia Feed app can be downloaded from the usual sources, for example App Store for iPhone.

Settings for Omnia Feed are found in Omnia Admnin. There are settings for the Tenant, mainly used by AM and the Omnia Feed Team to set up the tenant, and then settings for each Business Profile. See this page for more iformation: :doc:`Omnia Feed - Business Profile Settings </admin-settings/business-group-settings/omnia-feed/index>`
