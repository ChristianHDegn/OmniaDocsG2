Using Omnia Feed
===================

**(This documentation is ongoing. More will be added soon.)**

With Omnia Feed users can stay connected to the organization's Omnia Intranet wherever they are. 

Omnia Feed can be set up in many different ways to make it possible for users to read information from their organization's intranet, on their mobile device. A good example is News, but it can be any page(s) really, and anything that can be accessed by a link. 

Here's an example:

Any number of tabs can be set up for access to different resources. A tab can be set up for:

+ A Rollupo (similar to a Page Rollup) to list news or other pages.
+ An Embedded link, which can be used to show the home page of an Omnia intranet, or to show some specific Omnia functionality - for example My Links or My Tasks.
+ An External link, which for example can be used as a shortcut to other applications (time report, HR system, etc).

Settings are found in Omnia Admin. There are settings for the tenant, mainly used by AM and the Omnia Feed Team to set up the tenant, and then settings for each Business Profile, where for example the tabs are set up. See this page for more iformation: :doc:`Omnia Feed - Business Profile Settings </admin-settings/business-group-settings/omnia-feed/index>`

The Omnia Feed App
*******************
The Omnia Feed app can be downloaded from the usual sources, for example App Store for iPhone.  

Regardless of how Omnia Feed is set up, using settings, a user can log out and select another Business Profile, if available.

The settings are available here:

My Feed and Product News are two different Page Rollups.

When reading news, users can see likes and comments for each News Article.

A user can like a News Article by selecting the hearth. To add a comment, the user scrolls down to the end of the article.

In this implementation example, there's also a link to the start page of the Omnia Intranet. It may need an additional login:
