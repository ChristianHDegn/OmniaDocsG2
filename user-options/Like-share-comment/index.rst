Like, share and comment
===========================================

Users can like, share and comment all pages, including News, that are set up for commenting. If it is, this is displayed at the bottom of the page:

To like the page, just click "Like". To Share the page, click "Share" and then you can e-mail the link to the page to someone else. The reciever(s) of the email must have read permission to the page for the link to work.

To comment, click in the field, type the comment and click "Post".

The author of a comment can edit or delete the comment by clicking the pen:

When a comment is deleted it works this way: If there are no answers to the comment it will just be removed. If there are answers, the  comment will be replaced with a text that states that it has been deleted and by whom. Everyone can delete their own comments. A Site Collection administrator can delete any comment. 

All users that can read a comment can like the comment and/or comment it.

You can click the hand to see a list of the users that has liked the page or comment.

When writing a comment you can use mentions to send a message to someone, for example the author of the page (news page or other).
