Form block
============

**This is ongoing, preliminary documentation for functionality to come in Omnia v6.5.**

Use this block to make a form available for users. 

A form can be a Survey, a Poll or a Checkup. These forms are created and maintained in Omnia Admin. See this page for more information: :doc:`Forms </admin-settings/business-group-settings/forms/index>`

Here's an example with a poll that the user already has submitted to, and only the result is available:
