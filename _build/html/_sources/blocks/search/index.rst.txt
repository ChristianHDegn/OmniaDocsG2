Advanced Search
===========================================

The Advanced Search block adds the same search functionality as the Advanced Search found in Quick Search. Settings for Search are set up in Omnia Admin, see: :doc:`Business Profile Settings - Search </admin-settings/business-group-settings/search/index>`


**Note!** This block needs a very wide area.

The user experience
********************
The first thing the user will see is this:

.. image:: adv-search-1.png

When the user has conducted a search something like the following is shown:

.. image:: adv-search-2.png

The search result diplays the number of hits in each search category. This search found 2 pages, 13 team documents, 3 published documents (meaning controlled documents) and 3 product manuals, all of which the logged in user has permissions to read.

As the next step the user selects one of the search categories, for example:

.. image:: adv-search-3.png

If refiners has been set up (as in this example) the user can narrow down the search result, if the list is long.

And finally, the user can click the link to open the page or document.

Settings
**********
You can add a title for the block if needed:

.. image:: advanced-search-settings-block-new2.png

If no variation exists for the page, it looks like in the image above and you can set the title in the languages active in the tenant. If variations exists, only one title can be set. In that case, titles in other languages are set in the variations.	

The tabs Layout and Advanced contain general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
