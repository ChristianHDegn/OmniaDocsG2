Through the Banner block a web editor can add banners on a web page.

The block can be used add centrally handled banners to a page, or for "local" banners, created and edited on a specific web page.

Adding a reusable banner
--------------------------
The default banner type is a custom banner used only on the current web page. If you want to use a centrally managed, reusable banner, select "Reusable Banner". This will display all available reusable banners in the list.

Select the reusable banner that you would like to show on the page.

You can't edit the banner itself. You can just add a reusable banner to the page. 

Adding a banner group
**********************
If banner groups are set up in Omnia Admin, you can add a banner group to the page. In a banner group, the banners will alternate every time a user enters or refreshes the page.

Select the banner group that you would like to show on the page.

You can't edit the banner group here. You can just add a banner group to the page. But you can choose that the banners in the group will be shown randomized (if not selected, the banners will alternate in the order they are set up).

Creating a custom banner
-------------------------
To create a custom, local banner, select "Banner" and use the following settings:

+ **View Template**: Defines how the banner should be structured:
  + *Image On Top*: Displays a big image at the top, above title, description and footer. Best suitable for landscape images.
  + *Title and description on image*: The image covers the whole banner area, title and description are placed as an overlay.
  + *Title on image*: A variant of the above, in this case only the title is placed as an overlay.
  + *Image On Right*: Diplays a small image to the right and the title, description and footer floating to the left of the image. Best suitable for portrait images.
+ **Link Url**: The url to open when the user clicks the banner.
+ **Open In New Window**: Defines whether the url should be opened in a new window or not.
+ **Pick link in advanced mode**: Click on this link to select a page or document in the current site collection, for the Link Url, using a link picker.
+ **Image and Background Color**: Select the image and background color that should be used by the banner.
+ **Title and Color**: Enter a banner title and a text color.
+ **Content and Color**: Enter the banner text and a text color.
+ **Footer**: If needed, add a footer to the banner and text color, that will be rendered below the content.

Targeting banners
-------------------
A banner can be targeted to any receivers that has been defined in Target Definitions. A targeted banner is only displayed to that group. No one else will see it. It works the same for Reusable banners and Custom banners.

For more information on Targeting Definitions, see: (link)targeting-definitions/index.html

To target a banner, do the following:

1. Add the banner, either a reusable banner, a banner group or a custom banner, as stated above.
2. Click the tab "Targeting settings".
3. Select "Target to".
