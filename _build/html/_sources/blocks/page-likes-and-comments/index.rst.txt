Page Likes and Comments
===========================================

The block makes it possible for the end user to like and comment a specific web page. It is also possible to reply to comments. Besides that, users can Share the page with others by e-mail.

It is possible for the end user to edit and delete a comment, made by the user, by clicking the pen icon.

When a comment is deleted it works this way: If there are no answers to the comment it will just be removed. If there are answers, the  comment will be replaced with a text that states that it has been deleted and by whom. Everyone can delete their own comments. A Site Collection administrator can delete any comment. 

Turning the options on or off
-------------------------------
When the block is added to a page (or to the Page Type), Authors can turn on or off likes and/or comments using Write mode.

This can be very handy if Page Likes and Comments is present in a Page Type, but should not be used on every page.

Settings for the block
************************
In the settings you can add a Title for the block and add some Padding:

+ **Title**: If a title should be shown for the block, add it in this field. If no variation exists for the page, it looks like in the image above and you can set the title in the languages active in the tenant. If variations exists, only one title can be set. In that case, titles in other languages are set in the variations.
+ **Enable Rich Text**: If you enable Rich Text, some basic formatting will be availble for the users. See image below for an example.         
+ **Enable Best Reply**: This is a preparation for functionality to come later.
+ **Enable Subscription**: This is a preparation for functionality to come. Not active at the moment. 

The tabs Layout and Advanced contain general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`

More on Likes and Comments

Users can like comments as well as pages.

A user can click the hand to see a list of the users that has liked the page or comment.

A user writing a comment can use mentions to send a message to someone, for example the author of the page (news page or other). 

**Note!** Likes on comments does not affect trending in any way.
