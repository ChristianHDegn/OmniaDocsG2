General Block Settings
===========================================

The Layout tab and the Advanced tab contains settings that are general for most blocks, but scoped for each block.

Adding filters to a block, if it's possible, works the same for most blocks. Find a general description of how to do that here: :doc:`Filter UI </blocks/general-block-settings/filters/index>`

Layout
*********
The Layout tab contain the following settings:

Spacing
--------
Use this setting to add some space from the block's border in to the content.

Style
------
Use these settings for block style:

+ **Chrome**: Select to have no Chrome setting or Boxed.
+ **Background color**: A default background color for blocks are set in Omnia Admin. You can set another background color for this block here, if needed.
+ **Elevation**: With this setting you can make the content of the block "stand out" from the page. See below for examples.

In this example there's no elevation set for the block:

.. image:: no-elevation.png

And here the elevation is set to 2:

The difference is noticeable at the left side and at the bottom.

Header
--------
For Header you can choose to use the global settings (set up in Omnia Admin) or use Custom Settings for this block.

For Custom Header Settings you can set the following:

"Separator Size" sets the distance from the heading to the content in the block. The rest of the settings - it's obvious what they do.

Targeting
-------------
A lot of blocks can be targeted to one or more groups using Targeting Properties. The Targeting Properties must be set up in Omnia Admin, see the section on this page: :doc:`Properties </admin-settings/tenant-settings/properties/index>`

To target a block, open the settings for the block and select "Add Targeting Filter".

Then select Targeting Property from the list. As the next step you can select to include all Children, or you can target one or more of the Children specifically. Here's an example with the Sweden office selected for the Office property.

You can add as many Targeting Properties for a block as is needed, this way. To remove a target, just click the X.

Advanced
***********
For some blocks you can use Custom CSS settings. You then use this tab.
