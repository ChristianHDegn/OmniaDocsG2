Reusable Content
===================

Content from one Omnia page can be reused on another Omnia page. It's true for variations as well. To be more precise, it is content from defined properties that are being reused, so applicable blocks must be present on the target page, for information to show up. 

A property that are not shown for users can be reused as well, for example Review date.

Note that blocks with reused content are locked on the target page. They can no be edited there. Reused content can only be edited on the source page. Therefore you may not want to reuse for example Title, as you most likely will want a different title on the target page.

Also note that "Enable reuse content" must be turned in the Publishing App settings for this to be available, see: :doc:`Publishing App Settings </pages/page-settings/index>`

Reuse Content
*******************
When you are editing a page where you want to reuse content from another page, do this:

1. Open the action menu at the bottom right:

.. image:: open-action-menu-new6.png

2. Select REUSEABLE CONTENT.

.. image:: select-reuse-content-new4.png

The following is shown:

.. image:: select-reuse-content2.png

3. Click ADD SOURCE PAGE.

The Page Picker starts and you use it to select a source page or variation. See this page for more information: :doc:`Page Picker </general-assets/page-picker/index>`

The properties that are or can be reused on the target page are listed, for example:

.. image:: reuse-content-list.png

If you don't want to reuse content from a certain property, click the dust bin to remove it from the list.

If additional properties are available, you can add any of them - so the content can be reused - using the "Select Property" list. You can edit the reuse list any time you are editing the target page, so you cab add or ermove reusable propeties as needed.

Also note that blocks reusing content are indicated this way:

.. image:: reuse-content-on-page.png

If you are reusing properties used for settings, that is indicated as well, for example:

.. image:: reuse-content-on-page-settings-properties.png
