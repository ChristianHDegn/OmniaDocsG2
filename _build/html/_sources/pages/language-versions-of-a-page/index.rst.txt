Language versions of a page
===========================================

Do you need to publish a page in more than one language? Then you use the option "Page Variations". (You can use the option for any variation of a page, not just language.)

First a Publishing App Administrator must set up the variations in the Page Settings, see this page: :doc:`Publishing App settings </pages/page-settings/index>`

Specific authors can be set up for a variation, and if not, all authors of a page can edit all variations.

To edit a page variation, for example for another language, do the following:

1. Edit the page.
2. Select variation to work with.
