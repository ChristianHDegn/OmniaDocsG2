Language versions of a page
===========================================

Do you need to publish a page in more than one language? Then you use the option "Page Variations".

You can use the option for any variation of a page, not just language.

You find the option among the Page Settings, see this page: :doc:`Publishing App settings </pages/page-settings/index>`
