Publish page changes
===========================================

As an editor you can work on a new version of a page as long as needed and publish the new version when you decide to do so. You can check earlier versions of a page and even revert to an earlier version if needed.

**Note!** Edits to a page are never shown to users of the site until the page is published.

Preview the page
*****************
A very good idea is to Preview the page before publishing. Do the following:

1. Edit the page.
2. Select "Preview".

You can now see how the page will look on a computer screen, a notebook, a tablet or a phone.

Here's a preview for a phone as an example:

Publish a page
***************
To publish a page, do the following:

1. Enter Edit mode.
2. Make sure all changes to the page has been done.
3. Save the draft.

(You can publish directly but saving the draft first is a safer way.)

4. Click PUBLISH.

If approval has been activated you must instead send for approval and the button's label indicates that:

Fore more information about Page Approval, see: :doc:`Approve Pages </pages/page-approval/index>`

Scheduled Publishing
*********************
If Scheduled Publishing is available you can choose to set a date and time for when the publishing should take place.

**Note!** Scheduled Publishing is never mandatory, even if it's available. If you don't need Scheduled Publishing, just publish the usual way.

1. To schedule Publishing, click here:

.. image:: scheduled-publishing-page.png

2. Click in the field and first set date:

3. And then set time, if you wish:

4. When you're done setting scheduled publishing, click "Save".

The color and name of the Publish-button changes to reflect that a Scheduled Publishing is set:

To edit the schedule, or remove the Scheduled Publishing all together, click the button.
