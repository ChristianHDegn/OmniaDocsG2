Page Types
==================

If you are Publishing App administrator you can work with Page Types. A page type contains sections where blocks can be placed for content. Sections can be targeted.

Some blocks can be added to a page type so they are a part of the layout presented to editors of a page based on the Page Type. 

When a new page is created, the Editor or Author can choose page type from any available in the page type list, or any Tenant Page Type, if available.

An unused Page Type can be archived (and then kept or deleted).
