Quick Search and Advanced Search
===========================================

Using Quick Search users can find information in a quick and convenient way. 

Here's an example of a search result:

Note the headings "People", "Pages" and "Documents".

Previews are available for pages and documents. For a preview, point at the page or document and click this icon:

When conducting an Advanced Search more tabs are available at the top and refiners can be available to the left. Note the number of search hits for each tab (category.

The refiners available (if refiners are shown) depends on what is available in the search result and the tab selected. Here's an example:

If, for example, the user would be interested in product manuals only, the refiner could be used to just show search results related to product manuals.

This is what the search result above would look like filtered on Product Manuals:

Advanced Search can also be added as a block to any page, see: :doc:`Advanced Search Block </blocks/search/index>`
