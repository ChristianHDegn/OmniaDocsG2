Theme for the Business Profile
=================================

Use these options to set Default Colors for the Business Profile. When working with a Block, an editor can often select other Colors, but if no other Color is chosen for the Block, these settings apply.

+ **Theme**: Select Theme from the list. 
+ **Primary**: If needed, you can adjust the Primary Color. 
+ **Secondary**: If needed, you can adjust the Secondary Color.
+ **Additional Colors**: To make sure editors can't choose any other color freely, you can use this section to set up alternative colors that will be available. Click "Add Additonal Color" to add more colors, and the dust bin to delete a color. (Don't forget to save when you're done.)
