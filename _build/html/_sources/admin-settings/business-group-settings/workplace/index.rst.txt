Workplace
============

This is an ongoing, preliminary documentation for functionality to come in Omnia 6.5.

In a Workplace you can create dynamic navigation etc for a Business Profile. The Workplace lives outside the Publishing App.

A Workplace can for example be used for different branding for different devices, within a Business Profile. This can, among other things, be useful in a Teams implementation.

You can always choose to use "Classic Action Menu & Mega Menu" for the Business Profile, and then the settings here are not used. This can be edited later in the tenant-settings, allowing for Workplace settings. For more information, see: :doc:`Business Profiles </admin-settings/tenant-settings/business-profiles/index>`
