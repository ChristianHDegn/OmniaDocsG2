Permission
============

For Workspace, the following settings are available:

.. image:: workplace-permission-new.png

+ **Allow mobile login**: This setting is intended to offer login to certain parts of Omnia for first line workers, partners and similar. The user needs the Kaizala app and a viable account.
+ **Business Profile Workspace Designer**: Add and remove Workspace Designers (administrators) here as needed.
+ **Business Workspace Reader**: Here you can set permissions for the Workspace navigation. 

In Omnia 6.7 and later, these permissions settings have been moved to general permission settings for the Business Profile, see: :doc:`Permissions for a Business Profile </admin-settings/business-group-settings/permissions/index>`.
