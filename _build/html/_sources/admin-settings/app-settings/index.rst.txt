An example: If your organization is using Document Management, you must go here to activate the Controlled Documents library for sites where working with Controlled Documents should be possible. (In this example Controlled Documents is already activated). If any updates to that Features is needed, you go here as well.

Edit settings
---------------
Here you can edit the settings for the App (site), which was set when the App was created. The settings available depends on the Provisioning Template selected for the App. See this page for more information: :doc:`Provisioning Templates </admin-settings/business-group-settings/provisioning-templates/index>`

Switching Template
-------------------
If necessary, you can change to another Provisiong Template for the App (site) here, but the recommendation is that you do that only for Apps that are not really used yet.
