==============================================

**This page is being updated. Will be finished soon.**

Here's an example of a Dashoboard set up:

.. image:: admin-dashboard-usage.png

Under Usage, information about active readers and active contributors are shown. What should be considered an active reader or an active contributor is defined in the Metrics settings, see: :doc:`Metric Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/metrics/index>`

Under Page Status, something like the following is shown:

.. image:: admin-dashboard-page-status-new.png

What you see in the example is the total status for the tenant. You can choose to see status for just one of the publishing apps and/or just one of the page types.

For Underused Content, something like the following can be shown:

.. image:: admin-dashboard-underused-content.png

What should be considered underused content is defined in the Metrics settings, see link above.

Regarding Reach: How well we reach our target audience based on what we expect. The metric can be configured to a specific scope of pages and have a target number of users.

How it's done
-----------------
The layout in this implementation example is a tab section with six tabs:

.. image:: dashboard-example-tab-section.png

The settings for the tabs are similar. Here's the first tab as an example:

.. image:: dashboard-example-tab-settings.png

For Style, "Show Active Slider" is selected so it's clear which the active tab is:

On each tab a Metrics block is placed, with the following settings:

**Usage**: For this tab the Scope is set to "User Activity",  with the following Metrics:

**Page Status**: Here the setting for Scope is "Pages" with the following Metrics:
