Exactly what is available can differ depending on how the Tenant is set up.

System
**********
+ **Enable Custom System Email** : As it states, this feature must be activated if Custom System Email functionality is needed in the tenant.
+ **Web Content Managament file storage**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **Teamwork provisioning using application context**: (A description will be added soon).

Default configuration
******************************
The purpose of these features is to provide a number of Enterprise Properties for an easy starting point, and ready to go app launcher links. You can then edit the properties lists and the app launcher links to your organization's needs. Add the common properties you would like to have in your tenant.

Note that default properties can not be deleted, but all can be edited. 

For more information on working with properties, see these pages: :doc:`Properties </admin-settings/tenant-settings/properties/index>`

Regarding M365 App Launcher links: Activate this Feature for a number of default links for the App launcher - many of the links that will normally appear in the Microsoft 365 menu. You can then use "Shared links" to edit the links and decide which ones to use. **Note!** Most links here will not be applicable in Omnia on-prem.

Integration
*************
Here's an example of what can be available here:

+ **Support Kaizala login**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **Microsoft Teams presence**: If activated, Teams presence is indicated by all people icons in Omnia (see below).
+ **Yammer posts and comments integration**: There's a lot of integration between Yammer and Omnia that is possible without having to activate this feature, but in order to use the new, improved Yammer integration where a post will be created in the selected Yammer community whenever a new page, matching the selected criteria, is created - this feature must be activated.

When Microsoft Teams presence is active, this type of icon indicates Teams presence:

In this example the icon indicates that the colleagues are offline at the moment.
