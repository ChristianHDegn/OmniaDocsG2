Business Profiles
===========================================

Within a Tenant several Business Profiles can be used, for different settings for different areas of the Tenant. Even if you will have the same settings everywhere in the Tenant, you still need one Business Profile, to set, for example, Themes (Colors), Central Image Locations and Content Header Settings.

Settings for Teamwork, the Notification Panel, Search and Provisioning Templates are also found among the Business Profile settings.

When adding and editing settings for a specific Business Profile, you must first select the Profile in this list. The available settings for the Business Profile are then available.

Workspace setting in Omnia 6.5
*********************************
In Omnia 6.5 you can choose to use Workspace settings within the Business Profile, or you can use a classic setup. You make that choice when editing the Business Profile here:

If you choose to use a classic setting, "Classic Action Menu & Mega Menu" should be selected. If you would like to use Workspace settings, deselect this option.

Migrating to Omnia 6.5
-------------------------
Workspace settings are not activated for existing Business Profiles when you migrate to Omnia 6.5. You can of course leave it as it is, meaning not using Workspace settings. If you do, the Workspace options will not be available for the Business Profile.

If you would like to to use Workspace settings you must create a Business Profile Workspace, this way:

1. Go to Omnia Admin and select Business Profiles in the Tenant settings.
2. Click the pen for the Business Profile.

3. Click "Create Business Profile Workspace".
