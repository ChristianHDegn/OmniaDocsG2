Document Templates
====================

Management of Document Templates is handled here. The templates can be available for Omnia Document Management only or as general templates as well.

The list of available templates can look like this:

Click the pen to edit a template. Click the dust bin to delete a template.

When editing a template, the same options are available as when creating a new template, see below.

Categories
*****************
If there are many templates you can use Categories to group them. Categories are applicable for normal templates only.

The first step is to create the Cateogories you will use (you can of course add more Categories later) and then add Categories when adding or editing templates. Using Categories is never mandatory, and even if you use them, some templates can still have no Category. On the other hand, a template can belong to more than one Category.

If Categories are used, users will see them as "folders" in the Document Wizard.

You can now either link to an existing, published controlled document, or prepare and upload a new document, to use as a template.

Link to a published Document
----------------------------------
To link to a published controlled document you have to know the Document Id (which you normally can see where the document is listed):

1. Enter the document-id and click "Find".

2. When you have found the document, click "Save".

**Note:** When a new edition of the linked document is published, the template is automatically updated. When an editor creates a new document based on document type with a linked document as template, the latest edition is always used. Existing, published documents are not changed.

Upload document
------------------
To upload a document to use as a template:

1. Select "Upload Document".
2. Upload the file by using drag and drop or click "Browse" to browse for the file and select it.
3. Click "Save".
