Document Termination
=======================

**(This documention is just started, more will be added soon.)**

If your organization uses Retention of Documents, the Retention Manager gets a notification by e-mail when a document has expired, with a link to this list. The Retention Manager can then decied if this document should be terminated or kept.

When a document is terminated, all files that belong to the controlled document is deleted and can not be restored.

**Note!** A Retention Manager must be have been set up in the system for this to work, see: :doc:`Document Management Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/document-management/settings/index>`
