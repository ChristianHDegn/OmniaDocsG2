Use this setting to add and remove Tenant Administrators. Only Tenant Administrators can use this setting and other settings under "Tenant" in Omnia Admin. 

A Tenant Administrator can also edit all the settings for all Business Profiles within the Tenant.

To delete an administrator here, just click the x. To add an administrator, add the name the same way as in other name fields.

External users that has been invited in the Asher AD can be added here as well. Users invited this way can log in with their own Office 365 account.

**Note!** There must always be at least one Tenant Administrator. If there is only one, that administrator can not be removed until an additional one has been added.

Secrets
********
When an extension has been installed for the Business Profile, get the security key/token and enter it here. 

You will most likely see "System Account" among the secrets. It's a standard extension for specialized implementations only.
