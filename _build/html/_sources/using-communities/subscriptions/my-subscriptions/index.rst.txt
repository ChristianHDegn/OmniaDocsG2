My Subscriptions
==================

Use My subscriptions for an overview of your subscriptions. You can unsubscribe using this as well.

My descriptions can be available in more than one way, for example in the "My Profile" menu.

Here's an example:

The left tab (show in the image above) lists all communities you subscribe to - meaning you subscribe to ALL activities in that community. 

The middle tab lists all knowledge articles and discussion you subscribe to, for example:

The tab to the right displays a list of all tags you subscribe to, for example:

You can unsubscribe to any subscription by clicking the dust bin.
