Authoring Controlled Documents
=================================

This section is intended for Authors of Controlled Documents. The work normally takes place in a Controlled Documents library in a Team Site (but also see :doc:`Alternative ways of creating Controlled Documents </working-with-documents/alternative-create/index>`). 

Who is allowed to author and approve (if approval is needed) is set up in Omnia Admin under Document Management. See this for more information on defining author permissions: :doc:`Document Management Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/document-management/settings/index>`

When a Team Site has been set up for Controlled Documents authoring, the following will be available for Controlled Document authors:

+ A documents library (Controlled Documents).
+ A Send for Comments Workflow.
+ A Publish Workflow.
+ A Tasks list.
+ Workflow History.
+ Document History for drafts.
+ Document History for the published editions.
+ Options for relating to other documents.
+ Options for relating to QM Processes (if Omnia QM is activated).
+ Options for creating a new draft from a published document.
+ Options for unpublishing a published document.

In a Team Site set up for Controlled Documents authoring, a library, usually called just "Controlled Documents", is available here:

In the Controlled Documents library, authors can find three tabs:

+ **Drafts** is used when creating and editing drafts for new Controlled Documents or when updating an existing document for a new edition. Note that there are several options available for creating a new draft document, see below.

+ **Tasks** (if shown) is a list of tasks for the documents – either for review or for publication – both active and finished.

+ **Published** display all published document in this Controlled Documents library. When a document is published it is removed from Drafts and is available on this tab. Here the options for creating a new draft, unpublishing and Document History are available, together with a number of additional options.

Most headings can be used to sort a list.
