Working with Events
===========================

**This documentation is just (really just) started. More will be added here soon.**

You create an Event Centre, a Page Collection, to house pages for different events, quite like what you do for News with the News Centre. You need at least one Page Type for Events, so editors can create pages for different events. You use a Page Rollup in the Event Centre to list the Event Pages.

There's two specific blocks available for Event Management - Event Participant List and Event Participant Counter. In all other aspects, you use available options for Page Types in Omnia to create pages with the information you want to display for the Event.

On an Event Page it will be possible for colleagues, and even external partners, to register for participating in the event. 

Options in Outlook will be used to display the event in the participants calendars and for communication between the participants and the event.

See these pages for more information:
