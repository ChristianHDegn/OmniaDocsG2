You can choose the following:

.. image:: print-process-settings.png

+ **All related process steps**: This prints all related process steps, both main processes and subprocesses. If this process is linked to from a main process, that main process will not be printed.
+ **Single process step only**: Select this to just print the step you see.
+ **Language**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **Include process drawing**: By default the process drawing (if any) will be printed. Deselect if you don't want that.

When you have chosen what to print, click PRINT PROCESS.
