Edit properties when authoring processes
==========================================

**(This documentation is just started, more will be added soon.)**

Before pubishing a process, you will have to make sure that all mandatory properties are added. Also note that the properties can't be changed for a published process. You always have to publish a new edition to be able to change properties.

Do the folllowing:

1. Click the "Properties" tab.

Available properties are set by the administrator creating the process type, see (linke to be added).

2. Edit the properties as needed and save.
