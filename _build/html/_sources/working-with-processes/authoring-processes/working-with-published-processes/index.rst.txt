Create Draft
**************
You can create a new Draft from a published process and start working on the new edition when you need it. The existing edition is still available for users until it's replaced, when the new edition is published.

For more information on how to create a new draft, see: :doc:`Create a new draft from a published process </working-with-processes/authoring-processes/working-with-drafts/new-draft-from-published/index>`

You can see the publication date for each edition, the author’s comment, if any, and who the process was approved by. You can click the link to view the process.

Unpublish Process
********************
If needed, a published process can be unpublished. The process will then not be available for end users. The document is also removed from the Processes library and a copy is placed in the archive.

**Note!**
A process can't be unpublished if a draft has been created for that process. The draft must first be deleted.

When "Unpublish" is selected, you get a second chance to change your mind:
