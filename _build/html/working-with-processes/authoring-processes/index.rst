Authoring Processes
======================

**(This documentation is just started. More will be added soon.)**

This section is intended for Authors of processes. The work always take place in a Processes Library in a Team Site. Who is allowed to author and approve (if approval is needed) is set up in Omnia Admin under Process Management.

When a Team Site has been set up for Process authoring, the following will be available for process authors:

+ A Processes library that only users defined in the author’s permission group can work with.
+ A Publish Workflow.
+ A Tasks list.
+ Options for relating to documents.
+ History for the published editions.
+ Options for creating a new draft from a published process.
+ Options for unpublishing a process.

In a Team Site set up for process authoring, a library, usually called just "Processes", is available here:

In the Processes library, authors can find three tabs (if all are shown, depends on settings):

"Drafts" is used when creating and editing drafts for new processes or when updating an existing propcess for a new edition. Note that there are several options available for creating a new draft process, see below.

"Tasks" is a list of tasks for the processes – either tasks for you or tasks you have set up for others – both active and finished.

When a process is published (approved for publication) it is removed from Drafts and is available on the "Published" tab. Here the options for creating a new draft, unpublishing and Process History are available.

Most headings can be used to sort a list.
