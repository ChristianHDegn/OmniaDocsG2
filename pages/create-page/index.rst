Create a page
===========================================

(This description is only just started, more will be added soon.)

When you need to create a publishing page, do the following:

1. Point at the Edit button.

2. Select to edit navigation.

The navigation structure with the existing pages are now opened to the left:

When already editing a page, you can open the navigation at the top left.

When the navigation is open, create a new page this way:

3. Open the menu for the page where the new page will be a sub page:

4. Select "Create Page".

5. Choose settings for the page:

+ **Page Type**: Open the list and select the Page Type you want to use (can be changed later).
+ **Title**: The Page Title will be shown when searching and as a node in the navigation (can be changed later).
+ **Url**: The last section of the Url will be based on the Title. You can edit it if needed. Note that the Url can't be changed once the page is created.
+ **Advanced**: Use this option to set som Advanced options.
+ **Create**: The page is created when you click this button, not before that.

When the page is created you add content by using Blocks, see: :doc:`Working with blocks </blocks/working-with-blocks/index>`

Every Block available also has a separate description, select the Block on this page for more information: :doc:`Blocks </blocks/index>`

Some default blocks can already be in place for the Page Type (more on that below), and besides that a wizard is started to help you with the necessary steps when creating a new page, for example:

6. Click "Next" for the next Wizard step.
7. Select a Contact Person for the page and add a Review Date, if needed. 
8. Add other property informaton if more fields are available.

The Review Manager will get an e-mail when a page is nearing it's Review Date, as a reminder that the page may need some attention.

9. Click "Next" to go the next Wizard step.

When the last Wizard step has been edited, something like the following is shown. What you will do next is really up to you, but to save a draft at this point is a good idea.
