Move a page
===========================================

You can always easily move a page to another position on the same level (within the parent node). By using the navigation tree, you can move a node (one page or a page with all sub pages) to any position in the navigation tree, even to other page collections within the publishing app. 

On this page, to move a page within the same level is described. For information on moving a node in the navigation tree, see: :doc:`Edit Page Navigation </pages/edit-page-navigation/index>`

Do the following to move a page within the same level:

1. Open the page in Design mode.

If you're already editing the page or the navigation won't open automatically, you can click here to open the navigation:
