Move a page
===========================================

You can always move a page to another position on the same lavel (within the parent node). It's also possible to move a node (one page or a page with all sub pages) to any position in the navigation tree. See this page for more information: :doc:`Edit Page Navigation </pages/edit-page-navigation/index>`

Do the following to move a page within the same level:

1. Point at the Edit button.
