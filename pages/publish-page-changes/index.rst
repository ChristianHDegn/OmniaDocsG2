Publish page changes
===========================================

As an editor you can work on a new version of a page as long as needed and publish the new version when you decide to do so. If allowed (set in Page Collection settings) it's possible to se a Scheduled Publishing if you don't want to publish directly.

**Note!** Edits to a page are never shown to users of the site until the page is published.

Preview the page
*****************
A very good idea is to Preview the page before publishing. Do the following:

1. Edit the page.
2. Select "Preview".

You can now see how the page will look on a computer screen, a notebook, a tablet or a phone.

Here's a preview for a phone as an example:

Publish a page
***************
To publish a page, do the following:

1. Enter Edit mode.
2. Make sure all changes to the page has been done.
3. Save the draft.

(You can publish directly but saving the draft first is a safer way.)

4. Click PUBLISH.

If approval has been activated you must instead send for approval and the button's label indicates that:

Fore more information about Page Approval, see: :doc:`Approve Pages </pages/page-approval/index>`

Scheduled Publishing
*********************
If Scheduled Publishing has been activated for the Page Collection you can choose to set publishing at a later date, and, if the property allow it, time.

**Note!** Even if Scheduled Publishing has been activated, it is never mandatory. You can always publish directly, as described above.

If you would like to schedule publishing, do the following:

1. Edit the page.
2. Go to the PROPERTIES tab.

The property used for scheduling is identified by a clock icon.

3. Click in the field and set acheduled publishing with the options available for the property, for example:

When a scheduled publishing has been set it's noted by the publishing button, now saying SCHEDULE.

4. Click the SCHEDULE button to publish.

The settings for Scheduled Publishing are described on this page: :doc:`Page Collections </pages/page-collections/index>`

Scheduled Publishing and Variations
--------------------------------------
You can also set scheduled publishing for a variation, the same way as decribed above. Note that you must set the publication for the variation at a later date/time than for the main page, for this to work.
