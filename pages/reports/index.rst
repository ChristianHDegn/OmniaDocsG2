You can sort the lists on most column headings by pointing at the heading and then clicking the arrow (not on the heading). An arrow pointing up indicates descending sorting, and an arrow pointing down ascending sorting, for example:

Usage

This list contains all pages in the Publishing App (see the top image). You can filter the list by using the fields and lists at the top.

You can use the links in the "Page" column to go to a page, and the links in the "Contact" column to go to a colleagues Delve page, where for example contact information is shown.

Checked out

In this list you can see all pages that are currently checked out, meaning someone is working on them. New pages are shown here as well, even if they are not published yet, as long as a draft has been saved.
