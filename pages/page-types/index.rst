Page Types
==================

**(This descrption is just started, more will be added soon.)**

An administrator or an editor with the correct permissions can work with Page Types. A Page Type contains sections where blocks can be placed for content. Sections can be targeted.

Some blocks can be added to a Page Type so they are a part of the layout presented to editors of a page based on the Page Type.
