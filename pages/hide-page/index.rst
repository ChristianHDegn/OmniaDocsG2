Hide a page
==============

Using this option you can hide a page, draft or published, or a whole section of main page and sub pages. Even a page that has been published for a while, with any number of versions, can be hidden.

You can then unhide (Show) when it's time to make to page(s) available.

While a page is hidden it can not be found through search, not by anyone, in fact even not by yourself. The only way to access a hidden page is through tha navigation when in edit mode.

You can hide any number of sub pages in one go. Just select the main page and hide, and all sub pages are also hidden. The reverse is also true, unhide the main page and all sub pages are also unhidden.
