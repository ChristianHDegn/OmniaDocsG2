Automatic Page Creation
=========================
**(This documentation is just started - really just - more will be added soon).

In Omnia v6 an administrator can setup rules in a Page Collection for automatic page creation.

It works this way: Whenever a page is published in the Page Collection and match a specific rule, a copy of the page will be published to another Page Collection in the tenant.

This can for example be used to make sure a specific type of news will be published in more than one News Center, for example both in the internal News Center and in a partner portal or a customer portal. But this is just one example, it can be used with any type of page.
