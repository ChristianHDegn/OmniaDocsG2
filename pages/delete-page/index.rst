Delete a page
===========================================

When working with the navigation you can delete a page that is no longer needed. Just remember that if other pages links to a page you delete, the links will no longer work. You have to edit or remove such links.

Also note that while you're editing a page, you can't delete it (see below).

Here's how to delete a page:

1. Open Edit mode and select to edit navigation.
2. Select the page to delete.

3. Open the action menu at the bottom right.

4. Select "DELETE".

5. Click "OK" to delete the page (or "CANCEL" if you change your mind).

What happens if you delete a page by mistake? When you have clicked OK to delete a page, it can't be undone, but it may be possible to restore the page. 

A deleted page is placed in a system dust bin so normally an administrator can help you restore a page, but that has to be done in a certain time span (default settings are 30 days but can vary, depending on system settings). System dust bins are emptied with regular intervals.

As stated earlier, you can't delete a page you're editing, so when this is shown at the bottom, it's not possible:

You must then select "DISCARD CHANGES" (or "SAVE A DRAFT"  or even "PUBLISH", but that is probably not applicable for a page you want to delete), for the "DELETE" option to be present in the action menu.
