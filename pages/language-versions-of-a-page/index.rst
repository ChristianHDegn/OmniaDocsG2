Language versions of a page
===========================================

Do you need to publish a page in more than one language? Then you use the option "Page Variations". 

First a Publishing App Administrator must set up the variations in the Page Settings, see this page: :doc:`Publishing App settings </pages/page-settings/index>`

Specific authors can be set up for a variation, and if not, all authors of a page can edit all variations.

In Omnia 6.5 you will have an additional option. You can either set up a variation for editing by a Variation Author, or you can set up a variation for Automatic Machine Translation. You can decide this for each variation, either a Variation Author or Automatic Machine Translation. Note that the default variation (the source page with the source language) can't be set up for machine translation.

To edit a page variation, for example for another language, do the following:

1. Edit the page.
2. Select variation to work with.
