Document Types
================

(This documentation is just started, more will be added soon).

When creating a new controlled document an author selects a Document Type. Document Types can be grouped. In that case the author first selects group and then Document Type within that group.

The settings displays all existing Document Types, and Groups, if they are grouped, for example:

The i icon can show information on syncronization of new or edited Document Types. Here's an example:
