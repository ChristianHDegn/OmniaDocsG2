Sign-off Requests
====================

This is new functionality to come in Omnia 6.5. It can be used for read receipts for pages, including news. One example of implementation is pages a new employee should study.

A preliminary documentation will be added soon.

A rollup block for Sign-off Requests, so managers and aministrators can keep track, will also be available: :doc:`Sign-off Requests block </blocks/sign-off-request/index>`
