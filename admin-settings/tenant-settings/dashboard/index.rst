Dashboard
===========

Dashboard functionality has been greatly improved in Omnia 6.5. Here you will find an ongoing, preliminary documentation.

In omnia 6.5, the complete dashboard has been moved to Omnia Admin (that is what is described here). A block will still be available, now called Metrics, to display status for either Teamwork or Pages or User Activity.

You can edit some of the metrics settings, see: :doc:`Metric settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/metrics/index>`

The Dashboard in Omnia Admin can look like this:

.. image:: admin-dashboard-usage.png

Under Usage, information about active readers and active contributors are shown. What should be considered an active reader or an active contributor is defined in the Metrics settings, see link above.

Under Page Status, something like the following is shown:

.. image:: admin-dashboard-page-status.png

What you see in the example is the total status for the tenant. You can choose to see status for just one of the publishing apps and/or just one of the page types.

For Underused Content, something like the following can be shown:

.. image:: admin-dashboard-underused-content.png

What should be considered underused content is defined in the Metrics settings, see link above.

Regarding Reach - a description will be added soon.

For Teamwork, you can see the number of active teamworks and if any has been created this week or this month:
