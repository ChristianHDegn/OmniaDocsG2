Dashboard
===========

Dashboard functionality has been greatly improved in Omni√° 6.5. Here you will find and ongoing, preliminary documentation.

You can display the dashboard in a Publishing App, as before, by using the Dashboard block. In 6.5 the dashboard is also available in Omnia Admin.

You can now edit some of the metrics settings, see: :doc:`Metric settings </admin-settings/settings/metrics/index>`

The Dashboard in Omnia Admin can look like this:

Under Page Status, something like the following is shown:

For Underused Content, something like the following can be shown:
