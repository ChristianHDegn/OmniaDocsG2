Exactly what is available can differ depending on how the Tenant is set up.

System
**********
+ **Enable Custom System Email** : As it states, this feature must be activated if Custom System Email functionality is needed in the tenant.

Enterprise Properties
******************************
The purpose of these features is to provide a number of Enterprise Properties for an easy starting point. You can then edit the properties lists for your organization's needs. Add the common properties you would like to have in your tenant.

Note that default properties can not be deleted, but all can be edited. 

For more information on working with properties, see these pages: :doc:`Properties </admin-settings/tenant-settings/properties/index>`

Mobile
*********
Here you can remove or upgrade the feature "Enable Mobile Login". More information about what Mobile Login is, is found under *Permissions* here: :doc:`Publishing App settings </pages/page-settings/index>`

**Note!** Mobile Login is not available in Omnia on-prem.

Add-ons
*********
Here you can remove or upgrade the Omnia Add-ons. For more information about these, see the following sections:

:doc:`Working with Documents </working-with-documents/index>`

:doc:`Setup Yammer in Omnia </setup/setup-yammer-in-omnia/index>`  

:doc:`Info Screen </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/info-screen/index>`

:doc:`Working with Events </working-with-events/index>`

:doc:`Working with Processes </working-with-processes/index>`

An important note about Yammer integration: There's a lot of integration between Yammer and Omnia that is possible without having to activate this feature, but in order to use the new, improved Yammer integration where a post will be created in the selected Yammer community whenever a new page, matching the selected criteria, is created - this feature must be activated. 

Default Content
****************************
The following can be avaiable here:

+ **Show Teams presence**: If activated, Teams presence is indicated by all people icons in Omnia (see below).
+ **Default App Launcher Links**: Activate this Feature for a number of default links for the App launcher - many of the links that will normally appear in the Microsoft 365 menu. You can then use "Shared links" to edit the links and decide which ones to use. **Note!** Most links here will not be applicable in Omnia on-prem.

When Show Teams presence is active, this type of icon indicates Teams presence:

In this example the icon indicates that the colleagues are offline at the moment.

Configuration
**************
Activate "Default Community Properties and Page Types" for a useful set of properties for communities and a set of ready made Page Types. Both properties and page types can then be edited.
