Note that an option to create Announcements for a specific Business Group also is available, see: (Link to be added)

+ **Status**: Select a Status, which is a Color that can indicate the status of Announcement.

+ **Targeting filter**: An Announcement can be targeted, which means just diplayed to a defined group of users. See below for information on how to do that.
