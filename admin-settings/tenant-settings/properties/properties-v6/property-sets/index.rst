Property Sets (v6)
====================

**(This documentation is just started, more will be added/edited soon.)**

This is as the name says, an option where you can create sets of several Enterprise Properties and handle the set instead of each individual property. As a first step Property Sets is implemented for Controlled Documents.

A list of useful Property Sets can already be in place, for example:

To edit a Property Set, click the pen. To delete a Property Set, click the dust bin.

When you edit a Property Set, something like the following can be shown:

This set consists of two Properties; Document Owner and Office.

The settings are used the same way as when creating a new set, see below.
