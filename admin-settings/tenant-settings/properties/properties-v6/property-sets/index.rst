Property Sets (v6)
====================

This is as the name says, an option where you can create sets of several Enterprise Properties and handle the set instead of each individual property. 

A list of useful Property Sets can already be in place, sorted after Type, for example:

5. Set additional settings for the Property, if required, by clicking the pen. Here's an example:

.. image:: property-set-add-additional-v6.png

Available settings depend on type of property. Here's som common examples:

+ **Required**: If this Property must be filled in, select this option.
+ **Allow multiple values**: If it should be possible to select more than one value in this field, select this option. Available for applicable fields only.
+ **Limit Level**: For a property that can contain several levels - for example Country, City, Office etc - you can limit the levels to choose from here.

6. Continue the same way until you have added all the properties for the set.
7. To change the order, use the icon to the far right, and drag and drop.

*********************
To edit a Property Set, click the pen. To delete a Property Set, click the dust bin.

Note that a deleted Property Set is not deleted right away. It is placed in the Property Recycle Bin. For more information see: :doc:`Property Recycle Bin </admin-settings/tenant-settings/properties/properties-v6/recycle-bin/index>`

When you edit a Property Set, something like the following can be shown:

The settings are used the same way as when creating a new set, see above.
