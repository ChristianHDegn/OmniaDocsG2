+ **Title**: Add a titel (name) for the Property.
+ **Internal name**: An internal name can or should in some instances be used instead of the Title, for example as a place holder. The internal name can not contain spaces.
+ **Type**: Select the Property type. It can be "Data", "Datetime", "Media", "Person", "Rich text", "Taxonomy", "Text" or "Yes/No". Most of the Types are self explanatory. "Data" is a system field that users never enter anything to. "Rich text" can be formatted. "Text" is plain text without possibility to format.

Deleting or editing a Property
*******************************
Use the dust bin to delete a property, or the pen to edit one:
