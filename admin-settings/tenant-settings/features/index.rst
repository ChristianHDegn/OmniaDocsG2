Default Enterprise Properties
******************************
The purpose of these features is to provide a number of Enterprise Properties for an easy starting point. You can then edit the properties list for your organization's needs. Add the common properties you would like to have in your tenant.

Note that some default properties can not be deleted, but all can be edited. See this page for more information: :doc:`Properties </admin-settings/tenant-settings/properties/index>`

Default App Launcher Links
****************************
Activate this Feature for a number of default links for the App launcher - many of the links that will normally appear in the Office 365 menu. You can then use "Shared links" to edit the links and decide which ones to use.
