Publishing Channels
===========================

This is new functionality to come in Omnia 6.7. 

Publishing Channels provide an alternative way of targeting information and putting pages into context.

If you enable Publishing Channels on a Page Collection, it will be possible for an author to set which channels the page should be published to, but it's always the owner of the channel, if any has been set up, that approves. It's possible to set up channels that does not require publishing approval.

Publishing Channels can be used in page rollups to show news articles and pages in different parts of the intranet. The end user can also subscribe to channels of interest.

Here, you administer the channels.
