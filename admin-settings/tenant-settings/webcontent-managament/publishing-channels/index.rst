Publishing Channels
===========================

This is new functionality to come in Omnia 6.7. 

Publising Channels provide an alternative way of targeting information and putting pages into context. Publishing channels are maintained in Omnia Admin. Note that channels are not meant for permissions targeting, rather for targeting to specific publishing locations.

If you enable Publishing Channels on a Page Collection, it will be possible for an author to decide which channels the page should be published in. In some channels the author might have permission to publish directly and in some channels it might require approval from a channel administrator.

Publishing Channels can be used in page rollups to show news articles and pages in different parts of the intranet. The end user can also subscribe to channels of interest.

A detailed description on how to use this functionality will be added soon.
