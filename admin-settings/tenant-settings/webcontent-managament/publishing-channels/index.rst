Publishing Channels
===========================

This is new functionality to come in Omnia 6.7. 

Publising Channels provide an alternative way of targeting information and putting pages into context. Publishing channels are maintained in Omnia Admin. Note that channels are not meant for permissions targeting, rather for targeting to specific publishing locations.

If you enable Publishing Channels on a Page Collection, it will be possible for an author to set the channels the page should be published in, but it's always the owner of the channel, if any has been set up, that approves. It's possible to set up channels that does not require publishing approval.

Publishing Channels can be used in page rollups to show news articles and pages in different parts of the intranet. The end user can also subscribe to channels of interest.

A detailed description on how to use this functionality will be added soon.
