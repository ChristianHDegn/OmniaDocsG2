Sharepoint Sync
================

Use these settings to configure the sync from Publishing Apps in Omnia to SharePoint Site Pages. What you do is map properties to specific fields in SharePoint.

Open the list for a field and select the property to map to.

+ **Enable Redirect To Omnia Page**: Select this option (default) to redirect Site Pages links to the Omnia page instead of the backend Communication Site Page, when applicable.

These synced pages will be picked up by and displayed by Microsoft Search. When the user clicks on an item in the search result, the user will be redirected to the correct Omnia page. 

**Note!** An administrator can override these sync settings for a specific Page Type, see the heading "Settings" on this page for more information:  :doc:`Page Types </pages/page-types/index>`
