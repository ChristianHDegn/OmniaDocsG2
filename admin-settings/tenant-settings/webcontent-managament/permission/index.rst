Permission (Web Content Management)
===================================

You can set admin permissions separately for Web Content Management, here:

Single users, Security groups and Microsoft 365 groups can be added here (In Omnia on-prem, Microsoft 365 groups can't be used).

This can, for example, be useful if one or more colleagues should be able to work specifically with Tenant Page Types.

Tenant administrators always have permissions for WCM, even if not listed here.
