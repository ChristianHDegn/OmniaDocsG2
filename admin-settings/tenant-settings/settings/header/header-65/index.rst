Header settings in Omnia 6.5
==============================

This is an ongoing, preliminary documentation for functionality to come in Omnia 6.5.

Here you can change the default settings for the Header in the tenant. In the header settings for a workplace for a Business Profile, you can then choose to inherit those settings or create specific settings.

App Launcher
***************
You can create the feeling that when entering Omnia the user is still in Microsoft 365, by adding the Omnia App Launcher. The Omnia App Launcher is fully configurable. It's placed in the same position as the App Launcher in Microsoft 365. Here you can edit the settings.

+ **Enable**: The first step is to decide to use the Omnia App Launcher or not. If it's not enabled, the space is simply empty.

Note that there's a feature available for the tenant to install default App Launcher links to make it really easy to get going with the Omnia App Launcher. For more information, see: :doc:`Features - Tenant </admin-settings/tenant-settings/features/index>`
