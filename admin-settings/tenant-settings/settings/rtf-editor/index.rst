RTF Editor Settings
====================

Use these settings to decide which default options should be available for the Rich Text Editor and the Limited Rich Text Editor, in the tenant.

**Note!** For some blocks a Custom RTF Editor can be created. If that is done it will override these settings.

Both lists are handled the same way.

1. Select and deselect options to be available in the editor and save when you're done.

(All options are not shown in the image above, there's a lot more.)

At the top you will see a preview of what the RTF editor will look like with the selected options.

Remove Formatting is not an option shown as an icon in the RTF editor. The option becomes available when it's needed - when formatted text is selected or when text with formattion is pasted.

Text Translator is the option for Machine Translations editors can use (Available at the bottom of the list, not activated in the image above). 

All other options should be fairly self explanatory.

Settings for Styles
--------------------
To edit the settings for Styles, click the cog wheel.

**Note!** You can use Text Styles to configure styles. The enabled styles from Text Styles are those shown in the above list. See below for more information on Text Styles.

Reorder the options

If you would like to reorder the options in the editor, use these icons to drag and drop:
