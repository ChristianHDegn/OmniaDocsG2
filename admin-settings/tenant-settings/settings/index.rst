Settings
====================

Here you can set the following:

Regional Settings
******************
Use these settings for languages, date and time, for the tenant. Other settings can be set for a Business Profile.

Languages
-----------------
Use this setting to select the languages that should be available for the user interface in the tenant. Note that this setting is for the user interface only. Language versions of pages are handled differently - Page Variations (under development). 

Do the following to select languages:

1. Click "Add Language".
2. Open the list and select a language.

3. Click "Add"
4. Continue and add all languages that should be available in the tenant.

You can add additional languages anytime.

**Note!** The list of languages is long, but that does not mean that the interface is available in all languages. You must make sure the interface has been translated to the languages you need.

To remove a language from the tenant, just click the dust bin.
