Settings
====================

Here you can set the following:

Regional Settings
******************
Use these settings for languages, date and time, for the tenant. Other settings can be set for a Business Profile.

Languages
-----------------
Use this setting to select the languages that should be available for the user interface in the tenant. These languages can also be used for Announcements and Shared Links. Language versions of pages are handled differently - Page Variations, see the heading "Variations" on this page:  :doc:`Page Settings </pages/page-settings/index>`

Do the following to select languages:

1. Click "Add Language".
2. Open the list and select a language.

3. Click "Add"
4. Continue and add all languages that should be available in the tenant.

You can add additional languages anytime.

**Note!** The list of languages is long, but that does not mean that the interface is available in all languages. You must make sure the interface has been translated to the languages you need.

To remove a language from the tenant, just click the dust bin.

5. Click "Save" when you're done.

Language displayed for a user
-------------------------------
What language a specific user will see for the interface, in Announcement messages and Shared links, depends on the user's Preferred Language setting in the Azure AD.

Date And Time
--------------
For Date And Time you can set the following:
