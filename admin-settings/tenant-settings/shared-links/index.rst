Shared Links
=======================

Using Shared Links a Tenant Administrator can create links that user can access through "My Links". It makes it possible to create a central list of links, in Omnia Admin, to resources that are commonly used within the organization. 

Some links can be mandatory and it's also possible to target links to certain groups. 

The end user can access the Shared Links in the My Links control. The list contains all active links. The user can decide which non-mandatory links to display and can add personal links there. 

These links can also be accessed through a Quick Links block on any page, see: :doc:`The Quick Links block </blocks/quick-links/index>`

There can be Shared Links specifically for a Business Profile. Such links are created and edited through the Shared Links option under the Business Profile. Options for Tenant Shared Links and Business Profile Shared Links are identical. Shared Links for a Business Profile can coexist with Shared Links for the Tenant.
