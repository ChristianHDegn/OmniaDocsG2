Promoted Search Results
===========================

This is new functionality to come in Omnia 6.7. 

Based on search feedback, it is now easy for a search administrator to add promoted search results in Omnia Admin.

Whenever a user search on any of the keywords of a Promoted Search Result, it will be shown on top of Quick Search and in the right-hand-side panel in Advanced Search.

A detailed description on how to use this functionality will be added soon.
