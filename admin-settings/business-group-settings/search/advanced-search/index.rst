Advanced Search
==================
When a search has been made in Quick Search, Advanced Search is available through a link at the bottom. Advanced search can also be made available using the Search block.

Here's an example of refiners for Pages, with 43 hits:

The user can now use the refiners to the left. Let's say, for example, that the user knows the page is authored by Anna Karlsson - it's just 5 pages:

Custom Search Target
**********************
If you activate this option you can change what will happen when a user clicks the Advanced Search link, for example after having made a Quick Search. This is useful for example if a specific Search Center should be used.
