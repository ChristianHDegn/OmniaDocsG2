Search Feedback
===========================

This is new functionality to come in Omnia 6.7. 

By default, it is now possible for end users to provide search feedback. The feedback feature is available in Advanced Search.

A search administrator can access and analyze the feedback in Omnia Admin. If submitted by the end user, the search administrator will get a snapshot of the first page in the search result. The search query and results can be further analyzed using the search data from the end user query.

A detailed description on how to use this functionality will be added soon.
