Teamwork
===========================================

Use these settings go to any Teamwork site to, for example, edit settings. You can also create a new Teamwork site, or Attach an existing site to Omnia.

For Team Sites with "Approval" as Site Creation Mode, you use the "Pending Approval" list to approve or reject creation of a Team Site.

Use the icons this way:

+ The key to edit permissions.
+ The boxes to activate, deactivate and upgrade features.
+ The pen to edit some settings.
+ The dust bin to delete the collaboration site. 

You can use the headings for App Administrator, Provisioning Template and Created Date to sort the list.

You can also search the list.

Available options depend on the template chosen. Here's some common ones:

+ **Title**: Add a Title (name) for the Team Site here.
+ **Description**: It's a good idea to add a Description of the Team Site's purpose here, but it's not mandatory.
+ **Show in public listings**: If links to this teamwork should show up in listings available for all colleagues, select this option. Default: selected.
+ **Sharepoint Alias**: The last part of the address to the site is created automatically but can be edited if necessary. If the name (address) already exists an alternative address is suggested.
+ **Languages**: The same language as the main Business Profile language is suggested. Another language can be selected if needed.  
+ **Time Zones**: Normally the correct Time Zone is already selected. Can be changed if needed.

5. When done, click "Next".
6. Now, set the following:

+ **App Administrator**: You are automatically added as the Administrator of the site. Add or remove Administrators as needed.

7. Click "Next".
8. Set Enterprise Properties if nedded.

See above for information about the options.

Features for the teamwork
***************************

What you can do is self explanatory, but be careful here and make sure you know exactly what will happen, especially if you plan to remove or upgrade a feature.

Attach a Team Site
*******************
Using this option you can attach any Team Site to Omnia. When a Team Site is attached you can handle the site through Omnia the same way as a Team Site created through Omnia.

Do the following:

1. Copy the Url for the Team Site you want to attach.
2. Go to Team Collaboration settings and click the plus.
3. Select "Attach Site".

The following is shown:

3. Paste the Url and click "Resolve".

Inactive
**********
If a Sharepoint or an Office 365 team site is deleted, it's placed in this list.

(More information about this list will be added soon.)

Pending Approval
*****************
When a user creates a Team Site where Approval is needed, an administrator uses this list to approve or reject creation of the site. Here's an example:

.. image:: pending-approval-new2.png

Approval (or Rejection) is done this way:

1. Click the link for the site.
2. Check the name, settings and so on for the site.
3. If everything is OK, click "Approve", or if changes are needed, click "Reject".

.. image:: pending-approval-approve-new2.png

If you approve the creation of the team site a message is sent to the person requesting the site, and the site is created.

If you reject, the following is shown:

.. image:: pending-approval-reject-new2.png

4. Type a message stating what needs to be done for approval, and click "Save" to send the message.

The person requesting the site receives the message and can then start a new Team Site creation with your comments in mind. 

**Note!** Requesting a Team Site must always be done from start each time. If rejected, nothing from the request is saved.
