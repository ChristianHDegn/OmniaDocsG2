Approval (or Rejection) is done this way:

2. Check the name, settings and so on for the site.
3. If everything is OK, click "Approve", if changes are needed, click "Reject".

If you approve the creation of the team site a message is sent to the person requesting the site, and the site is created.

If you reject, the following is shown:

4. Type a message stating what needs to be done for approval, and click "Save" to send the message.

The person requesting the site recieves the message and can then start a new team site creation with your comments in mind. 

**Note!** Requesting a Team Site must always be done from the start. If rejected, nothing from the request is saved.
