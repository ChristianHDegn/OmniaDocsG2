Navigation Bar
=================

This is an ongoing preliminary documentation for functionality to come in Omnia 6.5.

Here you can edit navigation bar settings for the business profile's workplace. You can add different settings for the default navigation bar and for the navigation bar used in MS Teams. 

When working with the layout, you can use all the sections and blocks that normally are avilable for pages, so the possibilities are almost endless. You can even add different layouts for different screen sizes, if needed, to fit for example both computer and mobile phone.

+ **Title**: If you would like to show a Home title, add it here, in any or all the tenant languages. Click the flag to change language.
+ **Logo Text**: If you would like to show a logo text by the Home title, add it here, in any or all the tenant languages. Click the flag to change language.

Another alternative is to add a logo image. Do it this way:

1. Click ADD.

2. Use the Media Picker to find and select the image.

See this page for more information: :doc:`The Media Picker </general-assets/media-picker/index>`

Working with the layout
*************************
When working with the navigation bar layout, you can use all options for sections and block available in Omnia.

Start by clicking the x symbol to add a section.

.. image:: layout-1.png

Then select section layout, just like you would do when working with a Page Type.

.. image:: layout-2.png

Then continue building up the layut using sections and blocks.

For more information, see these sections:

+ :doc:`Working with section and blocks </pages/page-types/working-with-sections/index>`
+ :doc:`Settings for sections </pages/page-types/sections-settings/index>`
+ :doc:`Working with blocks </blocks/working-with-blocks/index>`

saving a draft and publishing
---------------------------------
Saving a draft, discarding changes and finally publishing the layout works very similar to working with pages.

.. image:: layout-3.png

For more information, see these sections:

+ :doc:`Edit a page </pages/edit-page/index>`
+ :doc: Publish page changes </pages/publish-page-changes/index>`

But note that it's very similar, not exactly the same. Some options for pages are not available here.

One thing that is perhaps not that obvious is how to delete a layout, if needed. You will find that option in the Action Menu:

Different layouts for different screen sizes
*********************************************
The default screen size is for computer screens. If would lkike to add a different layout for one or more of the other scren sizes available, do the following:

1. Select Screen size.
