Workplace
============

This is an ongoing, preliminary documentation for functionality to come in Omnia 6.5.

The Workplace settings can be used to create dynamic navigation etc for a Business Profile. The Workplace lives outside the Publishing App.

You can always choose to use "Classic Action Menu & Mega Menu" for the Business Profile, and start working with these settings. For more information, see: :doc:`Business Profiles </admin-settings/tenant-settings/business-profiles/index>`

"Classic Action Menu & Mega Menu" can be deselected later in the tenant-settings, allowing for Workplace settings to be implemented.
