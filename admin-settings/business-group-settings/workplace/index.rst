Workplace
============

This is an ongoing, preliminary documentation for functionality to come in Omnia 6.5.

In a Workplace you can create dynamic navigation etc for a Business Profile. The Workplace lives outside the Publishing App.

A Workplace can for example be used for different branding for different devices, within a Business Profile. This can, among other things, be useful in a Teams implementation.

When a Business Profile is set up in the Tenant-setting, "Classic Action Menu & Mega Menu" can be selected, and then the settings here are not used. This can be edited later, in the tenant-settings, allowing these Workplace settings. For more information, see: :doc:`Business Profiles </admin-settings/tenant-settings/business-profiles/index>`
