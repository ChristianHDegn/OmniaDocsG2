Shared Links
===========================================

Using Shared Links a Business Profile Administrator can create Business Profile specific links that users can access through "My Links".  

Some links can be mandatory and it's also possible to target links to certain groups. 

The end user can access the Shared Links in the My Links control, which can display Tenant level links and Business Profile links for the active Business profile for the page. The list contains all active links. The user can decide which non-mandatory links to display and can add personal links there. 

These links can also be accessed through a Quick Links block on any page, see: :doc:`The Quick Links block </blocks/quick-links/index>`

Options for Tenant Shared Links and Business Profile Shared Links are identical. For information on how to create and edit Shared Links, see: :doc:`Shared Links (Tenant) </admin-settings/tenant-settings/shared-links/index>`
