Publishing
=================

Within a Business Profile several Publishing Apps can be active for different settings. To be able to create a Publishing App, at least one Provisioning Template for Publishing Apps must be available. If none are, create a Provisioning Template first.

The existing Publishing Apps are shown in a list:

Use the icons this way:

+ The key to edit permissions for the Publishing Apps.
+ The boxes to activate, deactivate or upgrade features.
+ The pen to edit the settings (same as when creating a new, see below).
+ The dust bin to delete a Publishing App that has been created by mistake.
