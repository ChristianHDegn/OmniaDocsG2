Announcements
===========================================

Here an administrator for this Business Profile can create Announcements that will be displayed in the specific Business Profile online only, normally at the top of the page. 

Business Profile Announcements can also be displayed through the Announcements block. For more information about the block, see: :doc:`The Announcements block </blocks/announcements/index>`

The options for creating and editing Announcements are identical to the options for Tenant Announcements, see this page for more information on how to create and edit Announcements: :doc:`Tenant Announcements </admin-settings/tenant-settings/announcements/index>`
