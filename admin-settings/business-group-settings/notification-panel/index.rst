Notification Panel
===========================================

The Notification Panel is a concept in Omnia. The purpose is to help end users find out what information has been updated within different areas of the intranet.

A Notification Panel can be placed on any page, or in the Action Manu, to show different notifications. You can create several Notification Panels for different purposes.
