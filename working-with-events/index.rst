Working with Events
===========================

Using a number of options in Omnia, together with a few dedicated options, you can publish information about different kinds of events (training sessions is one example) and can handle registration of participants for the event.

Important Event options:

+ Users can register to a Participant list. The list keeps track of available seats.
+ Users can register to a Reservation list if all seats are taken.
+ Colleagues will automatically be moved from the Reservation list to the Participant list and can also be moved manually by an Event Manager.
+ Users can register a number of (not named) colleagues that will accompany them to the event.
+ A user can register for others.
+ Users can edit or remove their own registrations.
+ External users that has been invited in the Asher AD, can use the Event options.
+ Event Managers can create new events, can edit all registrations and remove registrations if needed.
+ Event Managers can export the Participant list to Excel and can communicate with participants through e-mail.
+ Event managers only needs Author permissions.
+ Event Management can be connected to an Outlook calendar for further options. 

There's a number of settings available to decide how Event Management will work. It can for example be set that a Reservation list should not be available and that users should not be able to register for others.

There's two specific blocks available for Event Management (see the links below). In all other aspects, you use available options in Omnia for Page Types so Event Administrators can create pages with the information they want to display for the Event.
