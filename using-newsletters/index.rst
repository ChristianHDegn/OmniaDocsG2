Using Newsletters
===========================

**This part of the documentation is just started. More will be added soon.**

There's a number of options in Omnia you can use to send newsletters, internally or externally, and a few extra settings for that purpose. These options and settings will be described here.

An overview of the available functionality for newsletters is found here: :doc:`Release Notes 5 </release-notes/5/index>`
