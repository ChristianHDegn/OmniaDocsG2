Using Newsletters
===========================

**This part of the documentation is just started. More will be added soon.**

There's a number of options and settings in Omnia you can use for a newsletter implementation, to send internally or externally through e-mail. These options and settings will be listed here.

Important setting
*******************
To be able to send (Newsletter) pages this setting must be activated for the Page Collection:

When that setting is active, the following tab is displayed in the page settings:

In this field both groups and individual e-mail adresses can be entered. This tab is available for Page Editors using Write mode.

Implementation example
************************
Here's a Newsletter implementation example. First an example of a newsletter archive:

The Page Type is set up with three blocks: a Text block for the heading, an Action Button block for the newsletter editor to use when creating a newslettter page, and finally a Page Rollup block to display the newsletter pages.

The Action Button has the following General settings:
