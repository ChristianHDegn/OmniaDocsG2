Using Newsletters
===========================

**This part of the documentation is just started. More will be added soon.**

There's a number of options in Omnia you can use to send newsletters, internally or externally, and a few extra settings for that purpose. These options and settings will be described here.

This description is meant for administrators setting up the newsletter functionality.

An overview of the available functionality for newsletters is found here: :doc:`General Block Settings </release-notes/5/index>`

Page Collection settings
********************************
The first you have to do, to create a solution for newsletters in Omnia, is to enable to send a page as e-mail. The setting is found here, for the Page Collection:

The best solution is most likely to create a separate page for newsletters, for the Newsletter Editor(s) to use. That page can also work as a Nesletter Archive, which users may have access to, depending on how you would like to set up the newsletter functionality.

Page Rollup for page picking
*****************************
The Page Rollup block can be placed on the Newsletter page to be used by the Newsletter editor to pick the pages (Most likely news pages) to be sent in the newsletter.

In the Page Rollup block, make sure you select the option Pick Pages. To select Pick in Write is most likely also a good idea.

Page setting for e-mail recipients
**************************************
The recipients for the newsletter sent from a page must be set up on this tab in the page settings:

You can add both groups and individual e-mail addresses in the field. You can add e-mail adresses to external partners as well.
