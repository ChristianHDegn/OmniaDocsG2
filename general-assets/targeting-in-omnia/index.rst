Targeting in Omnia
==============================================

In many places in Omnia you can choose to target information, meaning to show information for a specific group or specific persons. Depending of what type of information it is, it can mean that only the targeted colleagues can see the information, or that certain information always should be available in certain lists.

**This is a work in progress, will be finished in a few days. In the meantime, see the existing descriptions of targeting in this documentation.**
