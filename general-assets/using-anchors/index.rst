Using Anchors
=====================================
Using anchors you can link to a specific place on a page in Omnia:

+ To a place in text.
+ To a block (heading).
+ To a Tab in a section (type Tab).
+ To a step in a section (type Stepper).
+ To a post in an accordion section (type Accordion).

For the section types, an anchor is created automatically for each tab, step or accordion post - it's actually the end part of the Url. Anchors in text or for a block, must be created by an editor or an author, when needed.

If there are several sections of the same type on a page, you can add a custom anchor instead of the automatically generated one, for each tab, step or accordion post.

To link to an anchor you use the Add Link general asset or an action button, type Link.

Within a page you can link by using the anchor name. To link between pages, you must use the full Url to the anchor.
