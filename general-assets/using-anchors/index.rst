Using Anchors
=====================================
Using anchors you can link to a specific place on a page in Omnia:

+ To a place in text.
+ To a block (heading).
+ To a section type Tab.
+ To a section type Stepper.
+ To a section type Accordion.

For the section types, an anchor is created automatically - it's actually the end part of the Url. Anchors in text or for a block, must be created by an editor or an author, when needed.

If there are several sections of the same type on a page, you can add a custom anchor instead of the automatically generated one.

To link to an anchor you use the Add Link general asset or an action button type Link.

Within a page you can link by using the anchor name. To link between pages, you must use the full Url to the anchor.
