Using Anchors
=====================================

**This is an ongoing documentation. Will be added very soon.**

Using anchors you can link to a specific place on a page:

+ To a place in text.
+ To a block (heading).
+ To a section type Tab.
+ To a section type Stepper.
+ To a section type Accordion.

For the section types, an anchor is created automatically - it's actually the end part of the Url. Anchors in text or for a block must be created by an editor or an author.
