Share Documents
===========================================

This is an ongoing, preliminary documentation of functionality to come in Omnia 6.5.

A block can be set up, for example using Action Button, to let users easily share a document with others by uploading it locally on a page. This can very useful, especially in a Comunity, but can be used in other types of apps as well.

Here's an example, where it's set up in a community, using the Action Button block:

.. image:: share-document-button.png

When a user clicks SHARE DOCUMENT, this is shown:

.. image:: share-document-button-upload.png

The user can upload by using drag and drop, add a description (Summary) and tag the document. Alos note that a name for the uploader is registered. The name can be change is the user uploads a document for someone else.

The user must click PUBLISH for the upload to start.

(More will added here soon)
