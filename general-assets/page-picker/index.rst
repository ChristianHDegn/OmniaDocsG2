Use the Page Picker this way:

Navigating and picking
**************************
1. Select Publishing App to the left.
2. To the right - select Page Collection within the Publishing App.

You can now browse the list of pages in a view similar to the page navigation, for example:

.. image:: page-picker-navigate.png

3. Navigate the page structure to find the page you want to pick (for a Page Rollup you can pick more than one).
4. Click to select a page (click again to deselect).
5. Click OK when you're done.

To remove a page, click the dust bin.

Search for pages
*****************
Another way is to search for pages: 

1. Select the Publishing App and the Page Collection.
2. Click the tab SEARCH.
3. Use the search field to search for pages.

A flat list of the pages in the Page Collection is shown, for example:

.. image:: page-picker-search.png

You can search the pages titles. Here's an example with a search for "our":

.. image:: page-picker-search-example.png

As you can see, the search result contains all page titles starting with Our, but also those where the title contains our somewhere, in this example Human resources and Training and Courses.

4. Click to select a page (click again to deselect).
5. Click OK when you're done.

I you picked pages through a block, the selected pages are now listed the same way as shown above.
