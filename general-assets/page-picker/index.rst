.. image:: page-picker-navigate.png

5. Click OK when you're done.

If you picked pages through a block, the selected pages are now listed. Here's an example in the Page Rollup block:

To remove a page from the list, click the dust bin.

Search for pages
*****************
Another way is to search for pages: 

1. Select the Publishing App and the Page Collection.
2. Click the tab SEARCH.

A flat list of the pages in the Page Collection is shown, for example:

3. Use the search field to search for pages. 

You can search the pages titles. Here's an example with a search for "our":

.. image:: page-picker-search-example.png

As you can see, the search result contains all page titles starting with Our, but also those where the title contains our somewhere, in this example Human resources and Training and Courses.

4. Click to select a page (click again to deselect).
5. Click OK when you're done.

I you picked pages through a block, the selected pages are now listed the same way as shown above.
